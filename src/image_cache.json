Its possible properties were refined in 2017, where it was one of two planets recovered from new data, the other being Tau Ceti f. It would orbit at a distance of 0.552 AU (between the orbits of Venus and Mercury in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses. If Tau Ceti e possesses an Earth-like atmosphere, the surface temperature would be around 68 \u00b0C (341 K; 154 \u00b0F). Based upon the incident flux upon the planet, a study by G\u00fcdel et al.

Based on the stellar parallax of the system, observed by Gaia, the system is located approximately 2,700 light-years (840 parsecs) away.\nIn 2007, Patrick Wils et al. discovered that NSVS 14256825 is an eclipsing binary, by examining the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) data. They also classified it as an HW Virginis type star, a binary pair in which variability arises from one star reflecting the light of the other as they orbit each other."

        "description": "TrES-2b (also known as Kepler-1b or GSC 03549-02811b) is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star GSC 03549-02811 located 750 light years away from the Solar System. The planet was identified in 2011 as the darkest known exoplanet, reflecting less than 1% of any light that hits it. Reflecting less light than charcoal, on the surface the planet is said to be pitch black. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a bulk composition similar to that of Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, but similar to many planets detected around other stars, TrES-2b is located very close to its star and belongs to the class of planets known as hot Jupiters. This system was within the field of view of the Kepler spacecraft.\nThis planet continues to be studied by other projects, and the parameters are continuously improving. A 2007 study improved stellar and planetary parameters. A 2008 study concluded that the TrES-2 system is a binary star system. This significantly affects the values for the stellar and the planetary parameters.\n\n"

As of February 2013, it is the smallest planet discovered around a main-sequence star, with a radius slightly greater than that of the Moon and slightly smaller than that of Mercury. The measurements do not constrain its mass, but masses above a few times that of the Moon give unphysically high densities.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-62e (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.03) is a super-Earth exoplanet (extrasolar planet) discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of Kepler-62, the second outermost of five such planets discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft.  Kepler-62e is located about 990 light-years (300 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.  The exoplanet was found using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Kepler-62e may be a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet; it lies in the inner part of its host star's habitable zone.\nKepler-62e orbits its host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger (in diameter) than Earth.\n\n"

When first announced, 70 Virginis b was considered to be within its star's habitable zone (preferably in the \"Goldilocks zone\"), but it was later confirmed that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent."

        "description": "HD 189733 b is an exoplanet in the constellation of Vulpecula approximately 64.5 light-years (19.8 parsecs) away from the Solar System. Astronomers in France discovered the planet orbiting the star HD 189733 on October 5, 2005, by observing its transit across the star's face. With a mass 11.2% higher than that of Jupiter and a radius 11.4% greater, HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.0 kilometers per second (152,000 meters per second; 340,000 miles per hour), making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for extraterrestrial life.\nThe closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733 b has been the subject of close atmospheric observation. Scientists have studied it with high- and low-resolution instruments, both from the ground and from space. Researchers have found that the planet's weather includes raining molten glass. HD 189733 b was also the first exoplanet to have its thermal map constructed, possibly to be detected through polarimetry, its overall color determined (deep blue), its transit viewed in the X-ray spectrum, and to have carbon dioxide confirmed as being present in its atmosphere.\nIn July 2014, NASA announced the discovery of very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets that orbited Sun-like stars: HD 189733 b, HD 209458 b, and WASP-12b.\n\n"

The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Russia, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Teberda is a mountain river in Dombay region (name of HAT-P-3).\nIn 2013, this planet was photometrically observed by Spitzer Space Telescope which characterized its near-zero eccentricity and low albedo.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-9c is one of the first seven extrasolar planets, exoplanets, discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, and one of at least two planets orbiting the star Kepler-9. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were the first exoplanets confirmed to be transiting their star. The planet's discovery was announced by the Kepler Mission team on August 26, 2010 after its initial discovery by Kepler. At the time, it was one of 700 planetary candidates noted by Kepler.\nObservations of the planet have suggested that it is a hydrogen\u2013helium gas giant that is slightly smaller than Saturn, and that it orbits nearby its star at .225 AU. Kepler-9c and b are notable in that the planets share a pattern of orbital resonance, in which the orbit of each planet stabilizes the orbit of the other. During the time it was observed by the spacecraft, the planet's orbit, which lasts on average approximately 38 days, shortened by 39 minutes every orbital period because of this effect. Its orbit, over time, oscillates slightly above and below a 2:1 ratio with planet b.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-5b is one of the first five planets discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is a hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger. It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter. Kepler-5b orbits Kepler-5 every 3.5 days at a distance of approximately 0.051 AU (7.6 Gm)."

        "description": "Kepler-9d (formerly known as KOI-377.03) is a planet in orbit around the Sun-like star Kepler-9. Initially discovered by Kepler space telescope, a terrestrial planet-searching satellite built and operated by NASA, Kepler-9d is most likely a Super-Earth, with an estimated radius approximately 60% larger than that of Earth's, although its exact mass cannot be determined. Kepler-9d orbits Kepler-9 every 1.56 days at a distance of .0273 AU from its star, an extremely close distance. Although Kepler-9d is the closest planet to its star in its system, it is named Kepler-9d instead of Kepler-9b because two gas giants, Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, were confirmed first. The original studies into the system first suggested that Kepler-9d might be a planet, but a follow-up investigation made by the Kepler team later confirmed that it was; the confirmation of Kepler-9d as a planet was made public with the team's paper, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. The team used telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to follow up on the Kepler space telescope's initial discovery."

        "description": "Kepler-7b is one of the first five exoplanets to be confirmed by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, and was confirmed during the first 34 days of Kepler's science operations. It orbits a star slightly hotter and significantly larger than the Sun that is expected to soon reach the end of the main sequence. Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter that is about half the mass of Jupiter, but is nearly 1.5 times its size; at the time of its discovery, Kepler-7b was the second most diffuse planet known, surpassed only by WASP-17b.  It orbits its host star every five days at a distance of approximately 0.06 AU (9,000,000 km; 5,600,000 mi). Kepler-7b was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. It is the first extrasolar planet to have a crude map of cloud coverage.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-62f (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.04) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope.  It is located about 982 light-years (301 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.\nKepler-62f orbits its parent star at a distance of 0.718 AU (107,400,000 km; 66,700,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 267 days, and has a radius of around 1.41 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun \u2013 thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or so. Based on its size, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet. However, key components of the exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies within the outer part of its host star's habitable zone.\nThe discovery of the exoplanet\u2013along with Kepler-62e\u2013was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler space telescope data release. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. According to scientists, it is a potential candidate to search for extraterrestrial life, and was chosen as one of the targets to study by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-69c (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-172.02) is a confirmed super-Earth exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting the Sun-like star Kepler-69, the outermore of two such planets discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is located about 2,430 light-years (746 parsecs) from Earth.\nKepler-69c orbits its star at a distance of 0.64 AU (96,000,000 km; 59,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 242.46 days, has a mass at least 2.14 times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.7 times that of Earth. Initial findings found that it could possibly be habitable, however updated analysis shows that Kepler-69c resides outside of the inner edge of the habitable zone, and thus is highly likely to resemble the planet Venus with temperatures and conditions far too hot to sustain any life, making it uninhabitable.\nThe discovery of the exoplanet was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler spacecraft data release. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "HAT-P-7b (or Kepler-2b) is an extrasolar planet discovered in 2008. It orbits very close to its host star and is larger and more massive than Jupiter. Due to the extreme heat that it receives from its star, the dayside temperature is predicted to be 2,630\u20132,880 K (4,270\u20134,720 \u00b0F; 2,360\u20132,610 \u00b0C), while nightside temperatures are 2,211\u20132,238 K (3,520\u20133,569 \u00b0F; 1,938\u20131,965 \u00b0C). HAT-P-7b is also one of the darkest planets ever observed, with an albedo of less than 0.03\u2014meaning it absorbs more than 97% of the visible light that strikes it."

It revolves around the star Kepler-9 within the constellation Lyra. Kepler-9b is the largest of three planets detected in the Kepler system by transit method; its mass is roughly half that of the planet Saturn, and it is the largest planet in its system. Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c display a phenomenon called orbital resonance, in which gravitational pull from each planet alters and stabilizes the orbit of the other. The planet's discovery was announced on August 26, 2010."

It was the third planet to be discovered by Kepler. Kepler-6 orbits its host star every three days from a distance of .046 AU. Its proximity to Kepler-6 inflated the planet, about two-thirds the mass of Jupiter, to slightly larger than Jupiter's size and greatly heated its atmosphere.\nFollow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation, which was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010 along with four other Kepler-discovered planets.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-10b is the first confirmed terrestrial planet to have been discovered outside the Solar System by the Kepler Space Telescope. Discovered after several months of data collection during the course of the NASA-directed Kepler Mission, which aims to discover Earth-like planets crossing in front of their host stars, the planet's discovery was announced on January 10, 2011. Kepler-10b has a mass of 3.72\u00b10.42 Earth masses and a radius of 1.47 Earth radii. However, it lies extremely close to its star, Kepler-10, and as a result is too hot to support life as we know it. Its existence was confirmed using measurements from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-90g (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-351.02) is a super-puff exoplanet orbiting the early G-type main sequence star Kepler-90, one of eight planets around this star discovered using NASA's Kepler space telescope. It is located about 2,840 light-years (870 pc) from Earth, in the constellation Draco. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. It orbits its parent star about every 210.5 days at a distance of 0.71 astronomical units.\nKepler-90g's orbital period changes by 25.7 hours between two consecutive transits, caused by gravitational perturbations from other planets in the system. Additionally, changes in the depth and duration of transit events led to an exomoon being hypothesized to orbit this planet. However, this candidate moon was later found to be a false positive.\nA 2020 analysis of transit-timing variations of Kepler-90g and h found a best-fit mass of 15+0.9\u22120.8 M\ud83d\udf28 for planet g. This is between the masses of Uranus and Neptune. Given a transit-derived radius of 8.1 R\ud83d\udf28, Kepler-90g was found to have an extremely low density of 0.15\u00b10.05 g/cm3, unusually inflated for its mass and insolation. Several possible explanations for its apparently low density include a puffy planet with a dusty atmosphere or a smaller planet surrounded by a tilted wide ring system (albeit the latter option is less likely due to the lack of evidence for rings in transit data).\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-10c is an exoplanet orbiting the G-type star Kepler-10, located around 608 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by the Kepler space telescope team in May 2011, although it had been seen as a planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called BLENDER that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.\nKepler-10c orbits its host star every forty-five days at a quarter of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. Initial observations showed that it has a radius more than double that of Earth, and suggested a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5\u201320% ices by mass. For comparison, the Earth's oceans represent only 0.02% of our planet's mass, with an additional amount potentially a few times this stored in the mantle.  However, in 2017, more careful analysis using both HARPS and HIRES data revealed that Kepler-10c is not a large terrestrial planet, but instead a typical volatile-rich planet of about seven Earth masses."

It was discovered via the transit method by SuperWASP, and follow up radial velocity observations confirmed that WASP-3b is a planet. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a similar bulk composition to Jupiter. WASP-3b has such an orbital distance around its star to classify it in the class of planets known as hot Jupiters and has an atmospheric temperature of approximately 1983 K.\nWASP-3b undergoes no detectable gravitational tugging from other bodies in this system.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to 3.3+2.5\u22124.4\u00b0."

It has a mass about double that of the Sun and has expanded to 20 times the Sun's radius, giving it a luminosity of 107 times the luminosity of the Sun. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 4,559 K, which gives the star the orange hue typical of K-type stars. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is slightly higher than in the Sun.\nThis star has three optical companions. At an angular separation of 173.1 arcseconds is a magnitude +9.1 star, which is of spectral type K0. A 10th magnitude star is located 221.2 arcseconds away, and the third is a magnitude +9.1 K2 star 321.2 arcseconds away. None of these have been confirmed as a physical companion."

The radius of the planet's orbit is 4.80 AU, 113 times more distant from the star than first companion. This takes 10 years to orbit. As it is typical for very long-period planets, the orbit is eccentric, referring to as \"eccentric Jupiter\". At periastron, the orbital distance is 3.60 AU and at apastron, the distance is 6.00 AU. The planet's mass is nearly 2 times that of Jupiter, but is likely to be smaller in size than the inner planet.\n\n"

It is one of the first candidate exoplanets to be directly observed (by infrared imaging). It was discovered in April 2004 by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile by a team from the European Southern Observatory led by Ga\u00ebl Chauvin.  It is believed to be from 5 to 6 times the mass of Jupiter and may orbit 2M1207 at a distance roughly as far from the brown dwarf as Pluto is from the Sun.\nThe object is a very hot gas giant; the estimated surface temperature is roughly 1200 K (930 \u00b0C or 1700 \u00b0F), mostly due to gravitational contraction.  Its mass is well below the calculated limit for deuterium fusion in brown dwarfs, which is 13 Jupiter masses.  The projected distance between 2M1207b and its primary is around 40 AU (similar to the mean distance between Pluto and the Sun). Its infrared spectrum indicates the presence of water molecules in its atmosphere. The object is not a likely candidate to support life, either on its surface or on any satellites.\n\n"

The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at a conference in Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler."

The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Brahe for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer Tycho Brahe."

        "description": "GJ 3021 b, also known as Gliese 3021 b or HD 1237 b, is an extrasolar planet approximately 57 light-years away, orbiting its bright G-dwarf parent star in the Southern constellation of Hydrus. It was discovered with the Swiss Euler Telescope at the Chilean La Silla Observatory in 2000.\nAs determined by doppler spectroscopy, the jovian planet has an elongated orbit about 0.5 AU from its host star and a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter. Its orbital period of more than 133 days is much longer than that for typical hot Jupiters.\nA study published in 2001 suggested that the usual inability to determine the orbital inclination of an extrasolar planet through radial velocity measurement had caused this mass to be severely underestimated. The astrometric orbit gives an orbital inclination of  11.8\u00b0 and a mass of 16 Jupiter masses, which would make the object a brown dwarf. However, later analysis showed that Hipparcos was not sensitive enough to accurately determine astrometric orbits for substellar companions, which means the inclination (and hence the true mass) of the planet are still unknown.\n\n"

The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 6.07, which is bright enough for it to be dimly visible to the naked eye. It lies at a distance of 58 light years from the Sun based on parallax measurements, but is drifting closer with a radial velocity of \u221210.5 km/s.\nThe spectrum of HD 189567 presents as an ordinary G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G3V. It has 83% of the mass of the Sun but 110% of the Sun's radius. The star is moderately depleted in heavy elements, having 55% of the solar abundance of iron, but is less depleted in oxygen, having 80% of its solar abundance. It has a low level of magnetic activity in its chromosphere. Age estimates range from 4.11 Gyr based on chromospheric heating to 11.26 Gyr from stellar rotation. The star is radiating 2.1 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,726 K.\n\n"

        "description": "GJ 1214 b (sometimes Gliese 1214 b, also named Enaiposha since 2023) is an exoplanet that orbits the star GJ 1214, and was discovered in December 2009. Its parent star is 48 light-years from the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. As of 2017, GJ 1214 b is the most likely known candidate for being an ocean planet. For that reason, scientists often call the planet a \"waterworld\". However, a recent study of the planet's internal structure informed by observations taken with the James Webb Space Telescope suggests that a \"waterworld\" composition is implausible, with the planet being more likely to host a thick gaseous envelope consisting of hydrogen, helium, water and other volatile species such as methane or carbon dioxide.\nIt is a super-Earth, meaning it is larger than Earth but is significantly smaller (in mass and radius) than the gas giants of the Solar System. After CoRoT-7b, it was the second super-Earth to have both its mass and radius measured and is the first of a new class of planets with small size and relatively low density. GJ 1214 b is also significant because its parent star is relatively near the Sun and because it transits that parent star, which allows the planet's atmosphere to be studied using spectroscopic methods.\nIn December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214 b.\n\n"

        "description": "LHS 3844 b, formally named Kua'kua, is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf LHS 3844, about 48.5 light-years (14.9 parsecs) away in the constellation Indus, discovered using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. It orbits its parent star once every 11 hours, and its radius is 1.32 times that of Earth. It has a low albedo, indicating that its surface may resemble that of the Moon or Mercury. LHS 3844 b probably does not have an atmosphere as almost no heat goes to its night side, and it has a dayside temperature of 1,040 K (770 \u00b0C; 1,410 \u00b0F). The presence of cloudy atmosphere with cloud tops above pressure level of 0.1 bar cannot be excluded though.\nIn order to explain the lack of atmosphere, it has been proposed that the planet was formed interior to the star system's snow-line, because if it formed beyond the snow-line it would have carried volatiles, on the surface and in a thick atmosphere, that according to models on atmospheric loss should have been enough to sustain an atmosphere to the present. The planet probably also formed with a volatile-poor outgassing mantle, in a stagnant lid regime, because if the mantle was similar in constitution to Earth's, with plate tectonics, then it should still have a thick atmosphere, unless the red dwarf consistently flared at an uncharacteristically extreme rate not yet considered in atmospheric loss models. An alternative explanation for the lack of atmosphere could be through a large impact event, one with enough momentum to strip the planet of its atmosphere and a large portion of its mantle. In order to explain the non-replenishment of volatiles via comets back onto the planet, it is also proposed that perhaps there is an outer gas giant in the star system.\nIt is thought that LHS 3844 b is tidally locked due to its surface being 'relatively cool', although this hypothesis could possibly be complicated by the fact that the research into the temperature of the planet assumed that there was no atmosphere, a point which is not definitively confirmed.\n\n"

Its radius is measured at around 1.1 R\ud83d\udf28, which makes it similar to the Earth in size. It was the third (and most recent) exoplanet to be discovered in orbit around this star; the other two, HD 63433 b and c, were discovered in 2020. Orbiting its star at a distance of 0.0503 astronomical units (7,520,000 km), HD 63433 d is the innermost planet orbiting HD 63433, and completes an orbit around it just every 4 days. Due to the proximity of its star, the planet is scorching hot, having a temperature estimated at 1260 \u00b0C at daytime. The proximity of its star also causes it to be tidally locked.\n\n"

The star is similar to the Sun and forms a binary star with a red dwarf star (WASP-8B) of half the Sun's mass that orbits WASP-8A 4.5 arcseconds away. The system is 294 light-years (90 parsecs) away and is therefore located closer to Earth than many other star systems that are known to feature planets similar to WASP-8b. The planet and its parent star were discovered in the SuperWASP batch -6b to -15b. On 1 April 2008, Dr. Don Pollacco of Queen's University Belfast announced them at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting (NAM 2008).\n\n"

It is located about 217.1 light-years (66.56 parsecs, or nearly 2.0538\u00d71015 km) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.\n\n"

The two stars orbit each other in a binary system, while the planet typically orbits farther from the center of the system than either of the two stars. In contrast, circumstellar planets in a binary system have stable orbits around one of the two stars, closer in than the orbital distance of the other star (see Habitability of binary star systems). Studies in 2013 showed that there is a strong hint that a circumbinary planet and its stars originate from a single disk."

        "description": "Ross 128 b is a confirmed Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, that is orbiting near the inner edge of the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Ross 128, at a distance of 11.007 light-years (3.375 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The exoplanet was found using a decade's worth of radial velocity data using the European Southern Observatory's HARPS spectrograph (High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Ross 128 b is the nearest exoplanet around a quiet red dwarf, and is considered one of the best candidates for habitability. The planet is only 35% more massive than Earth, receives only 38% more starlight, and is expected to be a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface, if it has an atmosphere.\nThe planet does not transit its host star, which makes atmospheric characterization very difficult, but this may be possible with the construction of larger telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\n"

Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet, radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004, the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet.\nThe planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, the value is exact. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-113) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days. The radius of the planet is only 9% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \"super-hot Jupiters\"."

It orbits the star WASP-19 in the Vela constellation. At the time of discovery it was the shortest period hot Jupiter discovered as planets with shorter orbital periods had a rocky, or metallic composition.\nA study in 2012, utilizing the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, determined the planetary orbit is well aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to -15\u00b111\u00b0.\nIn 2013, secondary eclipse and orbital phases were barely observed from the data gathered with ASTEP telescope, making it the first detection of such kind through ground-based observations. This was possible due to the large size of the planet and its small semi-major axis.\nIn 2019 the planet was observed with TESS and the eclipse of the planet was measured. The broad variations caused by the changing aspect of the heated face of the planet were measured. The study deduced that the dayside has a temperature of 2240 \u00b1 40 K (1967 \u00b1 40 \u00b0C) and that the planet reflects 16 \u00b1 4 percent of the light that falls on it. The last value is relatively high compared to other planets.\nDespite the short orbital period, orbital decay of WASP-19b was not detected as of 2019."

The planet has a mass half that of Jupiter, but its insolation has forced a thermal expansion of its radius to greater than that of Jupiter. Thus, this planet is an inflated hot Jupiter. Starspots on the host star WASP-6 helped to refine the measurements of the mass and the radius of the planet."

At a distance of 5.96 light-years (1.83 pc) from Earth, it is the fourth-nearest-known individual star to the Sun after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system, and is the closest star in the northern celestial hemisphere. Its stellar mass is about 16% of the Sun's, and it has 19% of the Sun's diameter. Despite its proximity, the star has a dim apparent visual magnitude of +9.5 and is invisible to the unaided eye; it is much brighter in the infrared than in visible light.\nThe star is named after Edward Emerson Barnard, an American astronomer who in 1916 measured its proper motion as 10.3 arcseconds per year relative to the Sun, the highest known for any star. The star had previously appeared on Harvard University photographic plates in 1888 and 1890.\nBarnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator. Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its astrometry, and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets. Although Barnard's Star is ancient, it still experiences stellar flare events, one being observed in 1998.\nBarnard's Star hosts at least one planet, a close-orbiting sub-Earth discovered in 2024, with additional candidates suspected.

        "description": "55 Cancri b (abbreviated 55 Cnc b), occasionally designated 55 Cancri Ab (to distinguish it from the star 55 Cancri B), also named Galileo, is an exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star 55 Cancri A every 14.65 days. It is the second planet in order of distance from its star, and is an example of a hot Jupiter, or possibly rather \"warm Jupiter\".\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Galileo for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors early-17th century astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei."

        "description": "CoRoT-7b (previously named CoRoT-Exo-7b) is an exoplanet orbiting the star CoRoT-7 in the constellation of Monoceros, 489 light-years (150 parsecs) from Earth. It was first detected photometrically by the French-led CoRoT mission and reported in February 2009. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, it was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's) and the first potential extrasolar terrestrial planet to be found. The exoplanet has a very short orbital period, revolving around its host star in about 20 hours.\nCombination of the planet's diameter derived from transit data with the planet's mass derived from radial velocity measurements means that the density of CoRoT-7b is about the same as that of Earth; therefore, CoRoT-7b is a terrestrial planet like Earth and not a gas giant like Jupiter. The radial velocity observations of CoRoT-7 also detected a second super-Earth, CoRoT-7c, which has a mass 8.4 times that of Earth and orbits every 3.7 days at a distance of 6.9 million km (0.046 AU; 4.3 million mi).\n\n"

The planet orbits at 24 AU from HR 8799 with an eccentricity greater than 0.04 and a period of 100 years.  Upon initial discovery, it was the innermost known planet in the HR 8799 system, but e, discovered later, is now known to be closer to their parent star.  Along with two other planets orbiting HR 8799, this planet was discovered on November 13, 2008 by Marois et al., using the Keck and Gemini observatories in Hawaii. These planets were discovered using the direct imaging technique.\nNear infrared spectroscopy from 995 to 1769 nanometers made with the Palomar Observatory show evidence of acetylene, methane, and carbon dioxide, but ammonia is not definitively detected. In 2021, the further detection of water and carbon monoxide in the planetary atmosphere was made with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)."

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 9.79 and is located at a distance of 37.6 light-years from the Sun. Both of the stars are low-mass red dwarfs with at least one of them being a flare star. This binary system has a circumbinary sub-stellar companion.\n\nThis star was mentioned as a suspected variable by M. Petit in 1957. In 1960, O. J. Eggen classified it as a member of the Hyades moving group based on the system's space motion; it is now considered a likely member of the Carina Near Moving Group. Two flares were reported from this star in 1969 by N. I. Shakhovskaya, confirming it as a flare star. It was identified as an astrometric binary in 1994 by W. D. Heintz, who found a period of 14.5 years. The pair were resolved using adaptive optics in 1999. Early mass estimates placed the companion near the substellar limit, and it was initially proposed as a brown dwarf but is now considered late-type red dwarf.\nThe primary member, component A, is an M-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of M0.5. It is young, magnetically very active star with a high rate of rotation and strong H\u03b1 emission. The star experiences star spots that cover 10\u201315% of the surface It is smaller and less massive than the Sun. The star is radiating just 4.4% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,484 K.\n\n"

It has a semimajor axis of about 1.95 AU, and its orbit is quite eccentric, at a little over 0.5.\nAstrometry of HD 81040 using Gaia, published in several papers, has determined an orbital inclination of about 111\u00b0. This, combined with the minimum mass, gives a true mass of 7.53 MJ. Since the inclination is high, there is a small chance that the planet transits."

It has an apparent magnitude of 9.09, making it too faint to be observed by the naked eye from Earth, but readily visible using a small telescope. It is located 146 light-years (45 parsecs) distant based on stellar parallax, and is currently heading towards the Solar System with a radial velocity of \u22123.9 km/s.\nThe star is about 15% smaller than the Sun in both mass and radius and radiates slightly less than half the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere. It has a spectral type of K1V and an effective temperature of 5,131 K (4,858 \u00b0C; 8,776 \u00b0F), giving the star an orange hue. It is 9.6+3.8\u22123.9 billion years old, making it much older than the Solar System. The star has a solar-like metallicity and displays similar amounts of stellar activity to the Sun, though when the star was only 150 million years old, it may have emitted between 3.7 and 127 times the high-energy luminosity of the Sun in the present day.\n\n"

        "description": "HR 8799 c is an extrasolar planet located approximately 129 light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus, orbiting the 6th magnitude Lambda Bo\u00f6tis star HR 8799. This planet has a mass between 5 and 10 Jupiter masses and a radius from 20 to 30% larger than Jupiter's.  It orbits at 38 AU from HR 8799 with an unknown eccentricity and a period of 190 years; it is the 2nd planet discovered in the HR 8799 system. Along with two other planets orbiting HR 8799, this planet was discovered on November 13, 2008, by Marois et al., using the Keck and the Gemini observatories in Hawaii.  These planets were discovered using the direct imaging technique. In January 2010, HR 8799 c became the 9th exoplanet candidate to have a portion of its spectrum directly observed (following 2M1207b, DH Tau b, GQ Lup b, AB Pic b, CHXR 73 b, HD 203030 b, CT Cha b and 1RXS J1609b), confirming the feasibility of direct spectrographic studies of exoplanets."

The mass of the exoplanet is about eight Earth masses and its diameter is about twice that of the Earth. 55 Cancri e was discovered on 30 August 2004, thus making it the first super-Earth discovered around a main sequence star, predating Gliese 876 d by a year. It is the innermost planet in its planetary system, taking less than 18 hours to complete an orbit. However, until the 2010 observations and recalculations, this planet had been thought to take about 2.8 days to orbit the star.\nDue to its proximity to its star, 55 Cancri e is extremely hot, with temperatures on the day side exceeding 3,000 Kelvin. The planet's thermal emission is observed to be variable, possibly as a result of volcanic activity. It has been proposed that 55 Cancri e could be a carbon planet.\nThe atmosphere of 55 Cancri e has been extensively studied, with varying results. Initial studies suggested an atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium, but later studies failed to confirm this, instead supporting an atmosphere composed of heavier molecules, possibly only a thin atmosphere of vaporized rock. Most recently as of 2024, JWST observations have ruled out the rock vapor atmosphere scenario and provided evidence for a substantial atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide.\n\n"

        "description": "WASP-18b is an exoplanet that is notable for having an orbital period of less than one day. It has a mass equal to 10 Jupiter masses, just below the boundary line between planets and brown dwarfs (about 13 Jupiter masses). Due to tidal deceleration, it is expected to spiral toward and eventually merge with its host star, WASP-18, in less than a million years. The planet is approximately 3.1 million km (1.9 million mi; 0.021 AU) from its star, which is about 400 light-years (120 parsecs) from Earth. A team led by Coel Hellier, a professor of astrophysics at Keele University in England, discovered the exoplanet in 2009.\nScientists at Keele and at the University of Maryland are working to understand whether the discovery of this planet so shortly before its expected demise (with less than 0.1% of its lifetime remaining) was fortuitous, or whether tidal dissipation by WASP-18 is actually much less efficient than astrophysicists typically assume. Observations made over the next decade should yield a measurement of the rate at which WASP-18b's orbit is decaying.\nThe closest example of a similar situation in the Solar System is Mars' moon Phobos. Phobos orbits Mars at a distance of only about 9,000 km (5,600 mi), 40 times closer than the Moon is to the Earth and is expected to be destroyed in about eleven million years.\nThe planet's dayside temperature, as measured in 2020, is 3,029 \u00b1 50 K (2,755.8 \u00b1 50.0 \u00b0C; 4,992.5 \u00b1 90.0 \u00b0F). A 2023 study found an average dayside temperature of 2,781+25\u221213 K (2,508 \u00b0C; 4,546 \u00b0F).\nA study in 2012, utilizing the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, determined that the planetary orbit is well aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, with a misalignment equal to 13\u00b17\u00b0.\nA 2017 study detected carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, without signs of water vapor. However, in 2023, the James Webb Space Telescope detected water vapor in the planet's atmosphere.\n\n"

It is located approximately 910 light-years away in the constellation of Andromeda, orbiting the star HAT-P-6. This hot Jupiter planet orbits with a semi-major axis of about 0.05 AU, and takes 92 hours, 28 minutes, 17 seconds to orbit the star. It has true mass of 5.7% greater than Jupiter and a radius 33% greater than Jupiter, corresponding to a density of 0.583 g/cm3, which is less than water.\nThe planet HAT-P-6b is named Nachtwacht. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by the Netherlands, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU, after Rembrandt's painting The Night Watch.\nThe sky projected angle between stellar and orbital axis is roughly 166\u00b0, making it one of the few planets that is in a retrograde orbit around its parent star. Observations made by Spitzer Space Telescope shows that the planet atmosphere has a weak temperature inversion, or no inversion at all, depending on how strong is the stellar chromospheric activity.\n\n"

It has a mass 78% that of Jupiter and a radius 140% that of Jupiter. As with most transiting planets, this planet is a hot Jupiter, meaning this Jupiter-like planet orbits extremely close to its parent star, taking only 3.92 days to orbit.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is mildly misaligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -16\u00b18\u00b0.\nThe name Alef was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Israel, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Alef is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet and also means bull.\n\n"

This planet was discovered by transit on December 5, 2008. Despite the designation as HAT-P-8b, it is the 11th planet discovered by the HATNet Project. The mass of the planet is 50% more than Jupiter while the radius is also 50% more than Jupiter. The mass of this planet is exact since the inclination of the orbit is known, typical for transiting planets. This is a so-called \u201chot Jupiter\u201d because this Jupiter-like gas giant planet orbits in a really close torch orbit around the star, making this planet extremely hot (in the order of a thousand kelvins). The distance from the star is roughly 20 times smaller than that of Earth from the Sun, which places the planet roughly 8 times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.  The \u201cyear\u201d on this planet lasts only 3 days, 1 hour, 49 minutes, and 54 seconds, compared with Earth's 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 10 seconds in a sidereal year.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is mildly misaligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -17+9.2\u221211.5\u00b0.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

It was discovered in 2016 by the Kepler space telescope. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured."

Since it orbits its star very closely, the planet is a strongly irradiated hot Jupiter. As seen from the Earth, WASP-28b transits its host star every 3.41 days taking about 3 hours to do so.\nThe planet was observed by the Kepler space telescope during the K2 mission engineering campaign in February 2014 as part of an early science demonstration. It was also observed from December 2016 to March 2017 during K2's campaign 12 which allowed a refinement of the system parameters."

        "description": "Pulsar planets are planets that are orbiting pulsars. The first such planets to be discovered were around a millisecond pulsar in 1992 and were the first extrasolar planets to be confirmed as discovered. Pulsars are extremely precise clocks and even small planets can create detectable variations in pulsar traits; the smallest known exoplanet is a pulsar planet.\nThey are extremely rare, with only half a dozen listed by the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Only special processes can give rise to planet-sized companions around pulsars, and many are thought to be exotic bodies, such as planets made of diamond, that were formed through the partial destruction of a companion star. The intense radiation and winds consisting of electron-positron pairs would tend to strip atmospheres away from such planets, thus making them unlikely abodes for life.\n\n"

        "description": "GJ 1132 b (also known as Gliese 1132 b) is an exoplanet orbiting GJ 1132, a red dwarf star 41 light-years (13 parsecs) from Earth, in the constellation Vela. The planet is considered uninhabitable but was thought to be cool enough to possess an atmosphere. GJ 1132 b was discovered by the MEarth-South array in Chile.\nIt had been called \"one of the most important planets ever discovered beyond the Solar System\": Due to its relative proximity to Earth, telescopes should have been able to determine the composition of its atmosphere, the speed of its winds and the color of its sunsets, if an atmosphere was present. This is due in part to the small diameter of its parent star (20% that of the Sun), which increases the effect on the star's light of its transits. The planet's diameter is approximately 20% larger than that of the Earth and its mass is estimated at 1.6 times that of Earth, implying that it has an Earth-like rocky composition.  GJ 1132 b orbits its star every 1.6 days at a distance of 1.4 million miles (2.24 million kilometres).\nThe planet receives 19 times more stellar radiation than Earth.  The equilibrium temperature is estimated at 529 K (256 \u00b0C; 493 \u00b0F) for an Earth-like albedo, or 409 K (136 \u00b0C; 277 \u00b0F) for a Venus-like albedo. The planet is likely to be hotter than Venus, as higher temperatures likely prevail at the surface if the planet has an atmosphere."

It is roughly 5 times as massive as Jupiter and orbits about 70 AU away from the parent star. It was detected at thermal infrared wavelengths (3.8 \u03bcm) through direct imaging, using the NACO instrument on the VLT. A debris disk has been detected in this system at submillimeter wavelengths and has been resolved in the far-infrared from data obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory.\nThe host star was considered a highly probable member of the Lower Centaurus Crux star forming region, until tentatively reassigned with 71% probability to the Carina association. The star has a mass of 1.6 solar masses making it a late A type star. It is located approximately 90 parsecs away in the constellation of Carina."

        "description": "Kepler-1649c is an Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Kepler-1649, the outermost planet of the planetary system discovered by Kepler\u2019s space telescope. It is located about 301 light-years (92 pc) away from Earth, in the constellation of Cygnus. \nKepler-1649c orbits its star a\ndistance of 0.0649 AU (9.71 million km; 6.03 million mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 19.53 days, has a mass 1.2x times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.02 times that of Earth. Based on its mass and radius, it is likely a terrestrial planet, though its proximity to its star means it may likely be tidally locked. Kepler-1649c is estimated to receive about three-quarters of radiation from its host star as Earth does from the Sun.\nIn 2017, Jeff Coughlin, the director of SETI's K2 Science Office, described it as the most \"similar planet to Earth\" found so far by the Kepler Space Telescope. The planet was initially deemed a false positive by Kepler's  robovetter algorithm. The  Kepler False Positive Working Group published its recovery on April 15, 2020. Its first scientific description was published in The  Astrophysical Journal Letters, with first author Andrew Vanderburg, in April 2020.\n\n"

        "description": "Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope for NASA's Explorer program, designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission. It was launched on 18 April 2018, atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle and was placed into a highly elliptical 13.70-day orbit around the Earth. The first light image from TESS was taken on 7 August 2018, and released publicly on 17 September 2018.\nIn the two-year primary mission, TESS was expected to detect about 1,250 transiting exoplanets orbiting the targeted stars, and an additional 13,000 orbiting stars not targeted but observed.  After the end of the primary mission around 4 July 2020, scientists continued to search its data for more planets, while the extended missions acquires additional data.  As of 6 July 2024, TESS had identified 7,203 candidate exoplanets, of which 482 had been confirmed. \nThe primary mission objective for TESS was to survey the brightest stars near the Earth for transiting exoplanets over a two-year period.  The TESS satellite uses an array of wide-field cameras to perform a survey of 85% of the sky. With TESS, it is possible to study the mass, size, density and orbit of a large cohort of small planets, including a sample of rocky planets in the habitable zones of their host stars. TESS provides prime targets for further characterization by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as well as other large ground-based and space-based telescopes of the future. While previous sky surveys with ground-based telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets and the Kepler space telescope has mostly found planets around distant stars that are too faint for characterization, TESS finds many small planets around the nearest stars in the sky. TESS records the nearest and brightest main sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets, which are the most favorable targets for detailed investigations.  Detailed information about such planetary systems with hot Jupiters makes it possible to better understand the architecture of such systems.\nLed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with seed funding from Google, on 5 April 2013, it was announced that TESS, along with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), had been selected by NASA for launch.  On 18 July 2019, after the first year of operation, the southern portion of the survey was completed, and the northern survey was started. The primary mission ended with the completion of the northern survey on 4 July 2020, which was followed by the first extended mission. The first extended mission concluded in September 2022 and the spacecraft entered its second extended mission  which should last for another three years.\n\n"

The binary nature of NY Virginis was first identified in 1998, and the extremely short orbital period of 0.101016 d, together with brightness variability on the timescale of 200 seconds was noticed, resulting in the identification of the primary star as a B-type subdwarf in 2003.  Under a proposed classification scheme for hot subdwarfs it would be class sdB1VII:He1.  This non-standard system indicates that it is a \"normal\" luminosity for a hot subdwarf and that the spectrum is dominated by hydrogen rather than helium."

        "description": "Oph 162225-240515, often abbreviated Oph 1622, and also known as Oph 11, is a pair of brown dwarfs that have been reported as orbiting each other. The bodies are located in the constellation Scorpius and are about 400 light years away. Mass estimates of the two objects are uncertain, but they are probably each higher than the brown-dwarf/planet dividing line of 13 Jupiter masses. Oph1622B is located 1.94 arcseconds from Oph1622A, at a position angle of 182\u00b0.\nThe discovery of the pair was announced in a 2006 Science article by Ray Jayawardhana and  Valentin D. Ivanov\n. The objects were discovered using telescopes of the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope in La Silla, Chile. The masses were originally reported to be lower, at 14 and 7 Jupiter masses, which would have made the smaller object a planetary-mass object, or planemo. The system was announced as the first reported binary system of objects this small. However, later observations and calculations have revised the masses upward. Close et al. estimate the mass of the primary, designated Oph1622A as 12\u201321 times that of Jupiter and 9\u201320 Jupiter masses for the less massive Oph1622B, while Luhman et al. assign values of 57 and 20 Jupiter masses. Despite the acronym \"Oph\" appearing in its name (implying that it may belong to the young Ophiuchus molecular cloud), Oph1622 is likely to be older than its originally adopted age of 1 million years. More likely, it is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius\u2013Centaurus association, which has an age of 11 million years. For an adopted age of 11 million years, the system has inferred masses of 53 and 21 Jupiter masses, similar to that derived by Luhman et al.\n\nThe distance between the two is approximately 240 AU\u2014a distance so great that Space.com wrote that \"their connection is so tenuous ... that a passing star or brown dwarf could permanently separate the two objects.\" As such, the discovery was reported as casting doubt on the theory that such free-floating planet-like objects have been ejected from a stellar system, such an event being too violent to leave them in such a wide orbit around each other. Given their wide separation and high masses, the system is best thought of as a wide brown dwarf binary rather than a binary planetary system."

Because it and Phobetor have very similar masses and orbit close to each other, they were expected to cause measurable perturbations in each other's orbits. Detecting such perturbations confirmed that the planets were real. Accurate masses of the two planets, as well as their inclinations, were calculated from how much the planets perturb each other.\n\n"

It was one of the first planets ever discovered outside the Solar System. It was discovered using the pulsar timing method, where the regular pulses of a pulsar are measured to determine if there is a planet causing variations in the data.\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Phobetor for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Planetarium S\u00fcdtirol Alto Adige in Karneid, Italy. Phobetor is, in Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep) who appears in dreams in the form of beasts.\n\n"

It has a mass between 4 and 7 Jupiter masses and a radius from 10 to 30% larger than Jupiter's. It orbits at 68 AU from HR 8799 (or 7 AU inside the inner edge of the dust disk orbiting the star) with an unknown eccentricity and a period of 460 years, and is the outermost known planet in the HR 8799 system.  Along with two other planets orbiting HR 8799, the planet was discovered on November 13, 2008 by Marois et al., using the Keck and Gemini observatories in Hawaii.  These planets were discovered using the direct imaging technique.\n\nIn 2009 it was discovered that the Hubble Space Telescope had in fact directly imaged HR 8799 b eleven years earlier, in 1998, suggesting that more exoplanets might be revealed through analysis of HST photographic archives.  Additional precovery images were also obtained by reanalyzing data taken in 2002 at the Subaru Telescope and in 2005 and 2007 at the W. M. Keck Observatory.\nBroadband photometry of HR 8799 b shows that it has thicker clouds in its atmosphere than do older, higher surface gravity substellar objects of the same effective temperature.\nNear infrared H band and K band spectroscopy of HR 8799 b published in May 2011 indicate a hydrogen rich, dusty atmosphere with disequilibrium CO / CH4 chemistry.\nNear infrared spectroscopy made with the Palomar Observatory show evidence of ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, and some methane. In 2015, the signals of water, carbon monoxide and methane were reported in infrared spectra taken at the Keck telescope. However, a reanalysis of the same data in 2018 shows that water and carbon monoxide are present, but that the methane detection may have been spurious. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope will be capable of confirming or disproving the presence of methane in HR 8799 b's atmosphere.\n\n"

        "description": "BD+20 2457 is a 10th-magnitude K-type bright giant star located approximately 4,800 light-years away in the constellation of Leo. The name refers to the Bonner Durchmusterung star catalog. This star contains a very small amount of metals, containing only 10% as enriched with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as the Sun.\nOn June 10, 2009, two planets were announced to be orbiting the star, with minimum masses 21.4 and 12.5 times the mass of Jupiter and orbital periods of 380 and 622 days for the inner and outer planets, respectively. A dynamical analysis reveals that the proposed system is unstable on astronomically short timescales and so the suggested planetary configuration is unlikely to be correct: further data is needed to determine a physically plausible explanation for the radial velocity variations. This conclusion of a dynamical unstable system depends on the planets masses. A later study found lower masses, which could increase the long-term stability.\nA study from 2021 using Gaia identified BD+20 2457 as a halo star on a retrograde orbit around the Milky Way with a highly eccentric orbit. The researchers constrain the minimum age and the stars upper mass to \u22658 billion years and \u22641 M\u2609. This decreases the mass of the planets to 13 MJ (BD+20 2457 b) and 7 MJ (BD+20 2457 c). The chemical abundances also suggest that the star formed from the Milky Ways protodisk. As an alternative it could have formed from debris of the Gaia-Enceladus galaxy as it merged with the Milky Way. If BD+20 2457 formed from the Gaia-Enceladus debris, then the star and its planets could have an extragalactic origin."

The object was discovered by the OGLE project, announced on July 5, 2002 and confirmed on January 4, 2003 by the Doppler technique.\nThe period of this confirmed planet was the shortest until the confirmed discovery of WASP-12b on April 1, 2008. \nThe short period and proximity of the OGLE-TR-56 b to its host mean it belongs to a class of objects known as hot Jupiters.\n\nThe planet is thought to be only 4 stellar radii from its star, and hot enough to have iron rain."

A planetary system of at least three exoplanets with sizes between Mars and Venus has been detected around this red dwarf on January 11, 2012, by the method of transits with the help of the space telescope Kepler.\nKepler-42 c is a planet with a radius 0.73 times that of Earth. It orbits its star in a little less than 11 hours at about 0.006 AU of its host star and has an average equilibrium temperature of about 445 \u00b0C (833 \u00b0F). Due to the temperature, it is not suitable for life.\nIt is tidally locked in a synchronous rotation. Thus, it makes one complete rotation each time it completes an orbit. As a result, there is an eternal day side and a permanent night side."

        "description": "Kepler-442b (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-4742.01) is a confirmed near-Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the habitable zone of the K-type main-sequence star Kepler-442, about 1,196 light-years (367 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra. \nThe planet orbits its host star at a distance of about 0.409 AU (61.2 million km; 38.0 million mi) with an orbital period of roughly 112.3 days. It has a mass of around 2.3 and has a radius of about 1.34 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is at least 40% less massive than the Sun \u2013 thus, it can have a lifespan of about 30 billion years.\nThe planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft using the transit method, in which it measures the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star. NASA announced the confirmation of the exoplanet on 6 January 2015.\n\n"

It was discovered by transit on October 2, 2007, which looks for slight dimming of stars caused by planets that passed in front of them. It is the fourth planet discovered by the HATNet Project. It is also called BD+36 2593b, TYC 2569-01599-1b, 2MASS J15195792+3613467b, SAO 64638b.\nIt is a hot Jupiter with 68% the mass and 127% the radius of Jupiter, and 41% the density of water (31% of Jupiter). Since the inclination is known by transit observation, the true mass is known. The secondary eclipse where the planet passes behind the star was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope leading to the discovery that the planet has inefficient heat transfer from its day to night side.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -4.9\u00b111.9\u00b0.\n\n"

The planet orbits Gliese 357, 31 light-years from the Solar System,  The system is part of the Hydra constellation. \nThe planet was discovered by the TESS team and announced in July 2019. The data confirming the presence of the planet was uncovered in ground-based observation dating back to 1998 while confirming the TESS detection of Gliese 357 b, a \u201chot earth\u201d that orbits much closer to the parent star. Even though Gliese 357 d is 20% closer to Gliese 357 than Earth is to the Sun, Gliese 357 is much smaller than the Sun. So it receives as much energy as Mars. As a result, it is estimated that the average temperature is -64\u00b0F (-53\u00b0C), but this temperature is survivable for humans; if there is a thick enough atmosphere, the actual temperature could be much higher. If humans traveled there using modern spacecraft, it would take them about 660,000 years to get there.  The planet is 6.1 times more massive than Earth and 2.3 times Earth's size. \n\n"

The planet is a sub-Neptune about 2.6 times the radius of Earth, with a 33-day orbit within the star's habitable zone. This means it receives about a similar amount of starlight as the Earth receives from the Sun. Initially discovered with the Kepler space telescope, it was later observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in order to study the planet's atmosphere.\nIn 2019 the presence of water vapour in K2-18b's atmosphere was reported, drawing attention to this system. In 2023, the JWST detected carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere of K2-18b. JWST\u2019s data has been variously interpreted as indicating a water ocean planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, and a gas-rich mini-Neptune. K2-18b has been studied as a potential habitable world that, temperature aside, more closely resembles a gas planet like Uranus or Neptune than Earth."

The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The planet was previously proposed in 2012 when reports of its host star recorded drops in its luminosity varying from 0.2% to 1.3%, which indicated a possible planetary companion rapidly disintegrating. In 2015, the planetary nature of the cause of the dips was finally verified. It is expected to disintegrate in about 40\u2013400 million years."

        "description": "Kepler-22b (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-087.01) is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22.  It is located about 640 light-years (200 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in December 2011 and was the first known transiting planet to orbit within the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. Kepler-22 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.\nKepler-22b's radius is roughly twice that of Earth. Its mass and surface composition are unknown. However, an Earth-like composition for the planet has been ruled out; it is likely to have a volatile-rich composition with a liquid or gaseous outer shell. The only parameters of the planet's orbit that are currently available are its orbital period (about 290 days) and its inclination (approximately 90\u00b0). Evidence suggests that the planet has a moderate surface temperature, assuming that the surface is not subject to extreme greenhouse heating. In the absence of an atmosphere, its equilibrium temperature (assuming an Earth-like albedo) would be approximately 279 K (6 \u00b0C; 43 \u00b0F), slightly higher than that of Earth's 255 K (\u221218 \u00b0C; \u22121 \u00b0F).\nThe planet's first transit was observed on 12 May 2009. Confirmation of the existence of Kepler-22b was announced on December 5, 2011.\n\n"

However, it is much younger than the Sun, less than one tenth as old with an age of about 400 million years. With an apparent magnitude of 6.9, it is not visible to the naked eye, but can be seen with a small telescope or binoculars. Based on its kinematic, rotational and lithium abundance properties, it is part of the Ursa Major Moving Group. There are three exoplanets orbiting it, one is classified as an Earth-sized planet, while the two others are mini-Neptunes.\n\n"

The planet has a mass and radius just slightly larger than that of Jupiter. This planet orbits very close to the G-type parent star, as it is typical for transiting planets, classing this as Hot Jupiter. It takes only 4.188 days (or 100.5 hours) to orbit at an orbital distance of 0.0488 AU).\nThe planet XO-5b is named Makropulos. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by the Czech Republic, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Makropulos is the name from Karel \u010capek's play V\u011bc Makropulos (The Makropulos Affair)."

        "description": "BD+20 2457 is a 10th-magnitude K-type bright giant star located approximately 4,800 light-years away in the constellation of Leo. The name refers to the Bonner Durchmusterung star catalog. This star contains a very small amount of metals, containing only 10% as enriched with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as the Sun.\nOn June 10, 2009, two planets were announced to be orbiting the star, with minimum masses 21.4 and 12.5 times the mass of Jupiter and orbital periods of 380 and 622 days for the inner and outer planets, respectively. A dynamical analysis reveals that the proposed system is unstable on astronomically short timescales and so the suggested planetary configuration is unlikely to be correct: further data is needed to determine a physically plausible explanation for the radial velocity variations. This conclusion of a dynamical unstable system depends on the planets masses. A later study found lower masses, which could increase the long-term stability.\nA study from 2021 using Gaia identified BD+20 2457 as a halo star on a retrograde orbit around the Milky Way with a highly eccentric orbit. The researchers constrain the minimum age and the stars upper mass to \u22658 billion years and \u22641 M\u2609. This decreases the mass of the planets to 13 MJ (BD+20 2457 b) and 7 MJ (BD+20 2457 c). The chemical abundances also suggest that the star formed from the Milky Ways protodisk. As an alternative it could have formed from debris of the Gaia-Enceladus galaxy as it merged with the Milky Way. If BD+20 2457 formed from the Gaia-Enceladus debris, then the star and its planets could have an extragalactic origin."

The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009."

        "description": "Gliese 581c  (Gl 581c or GJ 581c) is an exoplanet orbiting within the Gliese 581 system. It is the second planet discovered in the system and the third in order from the star. With a mass about 6.8 times that of the Earth, it is classified as a super-Earth (a category of planets with masses greater than Earth's up to ten Earth masses).\nAt the time of its discovery in 2007, Gliese 581c gained interest from astronomers because it was reported to be the first potentially Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its star, with a temperature right for liquid water on its surface, and, by extension, potentially capable of supporting extremophile forms of Earth-like life. However, further research cast doubt upon the planet's habitability. Based on newer models of the habitable zone, the planet is likely too hot to be potentially habitable.\nIn astronomical terms, the Gliese 581 system is relatively close to Earth, at 20.55 light-years (194 trillion kilometres; 121 trillion miles) in the direction of the constellation of Libra. This distance, along with the declination and right ascension coordinates, give its exact location in the Milky Way.\n\n"

SPECULOOS-3 b takes only about 17 hours to complete an orbit around SPECULOOS-3, and, because of that proximity, it receives very high levels of radiation and is tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet always faces its host star. Its discovery was made using the SPECULOOS project, and announced in May 2024 in the academic journal Nature Astronomy.\nThe host star of SPECULOOS-3 b is SPECULOOS-3 (LSPM J2049+3336, TIC 230741378), an ultra-cool red dwarf star in the constellation Cygnus, with just one tenth of the Sun's mass, 13% of the size and 0.09% of its luminosity."

It takes about 4.6 years to orbit its G-type star and was initially believed to have a minimal mass of 0.92 Jupiters. Discovery of the second planet in the system has led to the revised mass of HD 86226 b in 2020, now estimated to be 0.45+0.04\u22120.05MJ."

        "description": "XO-1b is an extrasolar planet approximately 536 light-years away from Earth.\nThe planet XO-1b is named Negoiu. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Romania, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Negoiu is the second highest peak in Romania.\nIn 2006, the XO Project, an international team of professional and amateur astronomers, discovered a Jupiter-sized planet, later named XO-1b, orbiting a Sun-like star. The team, led by Peter R. McCullough of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, had four amateur astronomers hailing from North America and Europe. An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.\nThe XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.\nFrom September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it. McCullough's team then turned to the McDonald Observatory in Texas for information on the object's mass and to confirm it was a planet."

        "description": "HD 209458 b is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus, some 157 light-years (48 parsecs) from the Solar System. The radius of the planet's orbit is 0.047 AU (7.0 million km; 4.4 million mi), or one-eighth the radius of Mercury's orbit (0.39 AU (36 million mi; 58 million km)). This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth-days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000 \u00b0C (1,800 \u00b0F; 1,300 K). Its mass is 220 times that of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater than that of Jupiter. The high mass and volume of HD 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant.\nHD 209458 b represents a number of milestones in exoplanetary research. It was the first of many categories:\n\na transiting extrasolar planet\nThe first planet detected through more than one method\nan extrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere\nan extrasolar planet observed to have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere\nan extrasolar planet found to have an atmosphere containing the elements oxygen and carbon\none of the first two extrasolar planets to be directly observed spectroscopically\nThe first extrasolar gas giant to have its superstorm measured\nthe first planet to have its orbital speed measured, determining its mass directly.\nBased on the application of newer theoretical models, as of April 2007, it is thought to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere.\nIn July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on HD 209458 b and two other exoplanets (HD 189733 b and WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.\nHD 209458 b has been nicknamed \"Osiris\" after the Egyptian god. This nickname has been acknowledged by the IAU, but as of 2023 it has not yet been approved as an official proper name.\n\n"

        "description": "WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b or WASP-11Ab/HAT-P-10Ab is an extrasolar planet discovered in 2008. The discovery was announced (under the designation WASP-11b) by press release by the SuperWASP project in April 2008 along with planets WASP-6b through to WASP-15b, however at this stage more data was needed to confirm the parameters of the planets and the coordinates were not given. On 26 September 2008, the HATNet Project's paper describing the planet which they designated HAT-P-10b appeared on the arXiv preprint server. The SuperWASP team's paper appeared as a preprint on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia on the same day, confirming that the two objects (WASP-11b and HAT-P-10b) were in fact the same, and the teams agreed to use the combined designation.\nThe planet had the third lowest insolation of the known transiting planets at the time of the discovery (prior to this, Gliese 436 b and HD 17156 b were known to have lower insolation). The temperature implies it falls into the pL class of hot Jupiters: planets which lack significant quantities of titanium(II) oxide and vanadium(II) oxide in their atmospheres and do not have temperature inversions. An alternative classification system for hot Jupiters is based on the equilibrium temperature and the planet's Safronov number. In this scheme, for a given temperature, class I planets have high Safronov numbers and tend to be in orbit around cooler host stars, while class II planets have lower Safronov numbers. In the case of WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b, the equilibrium temperature is 1030 K and the Safronov number is 0.047\u00b10.003, which means it is located close to the dividing line between the class I and class II planets.\nThe planet is in a binary star system, the second star is WASP-11 B, with a mass 0.34 \u00b1 0.05 of the Sun and a temperature of 3483 \u00b1 43 K.\n\n"

The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-quarters of the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might be caused by a core that is of low mass or that is not present at all.\nThe planet orbits at approximately 5% of the distance between the Sun and Earth every four days. The star was observed several times between 2006 and 2009, at first through the SuperWASP program and later through focused follow-up observations. Analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of Cruinlagh, which was reported in a journal on April 7, 2009. A follow-up study published in 2011 investigated the cause for inflated planets such as Cruinlagh, and re-examined (and re-constrained) its mass, radius, density, and age."

        "description": "109 Piscium b (aka HD 10697 b) is a long-period extrasolar planet discovered in orbit around 109 Piscium. It is about 5.74 times the mass of Jupiter and is likely to be a gas giant. As is common for long-period planets discovered around other stars, it has an orbital eccentricity greater than that of Jupiter.\nThe discoverers estimate its effective temperature as 264 K from solar heating, but it could be at least 10 to 20 K warmer because of internal heating. It orbits within the habitable zone.\nPreliminary astrometric measurements suggested that the orbital inclination is 170.3\u00b0, yielding an object mass of 38 times that of Jupiter, which would make it a brown dwarf. However, subsequent analysis indicates that the precision of the measurements used to derive the astrometric orbit is insufficient to constrain the parameters. A more plausible suggestion is that this planet shares its star's inclination, of 69+21\u221226\u00b0. In 2022, the inclination and true mass of 109 Piscium b were measured via astrometry. The inclination estimate is consistent with that of the stellar rotation.\n\n"

The distance between the planet and the star is only a tenth of the distance between Earth and the Sun (0.1AU). A number of such worlds are known to exist, but the eccentricity of this planet is unusually high. Planets orbiting very close to their parent stars usually have round orbits because of the tidal forces between the bodies.\nIn December 2019, the International Astronomical Union announced the exoplanet will bear the name Tumearandu, after the popular character Tum\u00e9 Arand\u00fa of the folklore of Paraguay. The name was a result of a contest ran in Paraguay by the Centro Paraguayo de Informaciones Astron\u00f3micas, along with the IAU100 NameExoWorlds 2019 global contest.\n\n"

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.43, making it visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, this star lies at a distance of about 38.9 light-years (11.9 parsecs) from Earth. Lambda Serpentis is moving toward the Solar System with a radial velocity of 66.4 km s\u22121. In about 166,000 years, this system will make its closest approach of the Sun at a distance of 7.371 \u00b1 0.258 light-years (2.260 \u00b1 0.079 parsecs), before moving away thereafter.\nThis star is 36% larger and 9% more massive than the Sun, although it has a similar stellar classification. It is shining with nearly double the Sun's luminosity and this energy is being radiated from the star's outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,901 K. A periodicity of 1837 days (5.03 years) was suspected by Morbey & Griffith (1987), but it is probably bound to stellar activity. However, McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more exoplanets around Lambda Serpentis with masses between 0.16 and 2 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 Astronomical Units."

        "description": "TRAPPIST-1d is a small exoplanet (about 40 percent the mass of the Earth), which orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone of the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, located 40.7 light-years (12.5 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method. The first signs of the planet were announced in 2016, but it was not until the following years that more information concerning the probable nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the second-least massive planet of the system and is likely to have a compact hydrogen-poor atmosphere similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars. It receives just 4.3% more sunlight than Earth, placing it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about <5% of its mass as a volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers. A 2018 study by the University of Washington concluded that TRAPPIST-1d might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The planet is an eyeball planet candidate.\n\n"

It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is one of the largest exoplanets discovered and at half Jupiter's mass, this made it the most puffy planet known in 2010. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in the exoplanet's atmosphere.\nWASP-17b's name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Costa Rica, during the 100th anniversary of the International Astronomical Union. Dits\u00f6\u0300 is the name that the god Sib\u00f6\u0300 gave to the first Bribri people in Talamancan mythology."

It was first announced on May 2, 2016, and later studies were able to refine its physical parameters.\nThe planet is about 37% more massive than Earth and about 39% larger in volume; thus its density is very similar. It is the innermost of seven planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, all of which are terrestrial, but is too close to its star to be in the habitable zone. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope announced in 2023 suggest that it does not have any significant atmosphere. Its albedo is very low, making it dark in color.\n\n"

It was discovered via the transit method, and then follow up measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed that WASP-2b was a planet. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a similar bulk composition to Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, but similar to many other planets detected around other stars, WASP-2b is located very close to its star, and belongs to the class of planets known as hot Jupiters. A 2008 study concluded that the WASP-2b system (among others) is a binary star system allowing even more accurate determination of stellar and planetary parameters."

The radius of this object is 1.217 times that of Jupiter. Astronomers announced their discovery on May 30, 2007, at the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii. Its discovery is attributed to the combined effort of amateur and professional astronomers working together on the XO Project using a telescope located on the Haleakala summit in Hawaii.\nDubbed an \"oddball\" planet, at the time of its discovery the planet was the most massive planet found in close proximity to a star, yet the orbit is significantly elliptical instead of circular, as would be expected. It is also considered a transiting planet, passing in front of its parent star during each orbit. It is the third such planet to be found by the XO Project which was specifically created to locate them."

It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star in 2017 using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The exoplanet is within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.\nThe second most distant known planet in its system, TRAPPIST-1g is a planet somewhat larger than Earth and with a similar density, meaning it is likely a rocky planet.\n\n"

Astronomers used the transit method to find the exoplanet, a method that measures the dimming of a star when a planet crosses in front of it.\nThe exoplanet was one of seven discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Three of the seven (e, f, and g) are in the habitable zone/\"goldilocks\" zone. TRAPPIST-1e is similar to Earth's mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux. It is also confirmed that TRAPPIST-1e lacks a cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, meaning it is more likely to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. \nIn November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the multi-planetary system, TRAPPIST-1e has the best chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet, and the one most worthy of further study regarding habitability. According to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, TRAPPIST-1e is among the best potentially habitable exoplanets discovered.\n\n"

The planet takes only a little over one Earth day to orbit its star, in contrast to about 365.25 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun.

Consequently, it has one of the lowest densities for exoplanets (\"inflated\" by the flux of energy from the star). On December 3, 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) reported detecting water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. In July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars.\nIn September 2017, researchers working on the HST announced that WASP-12b reflects just 6% of the light that shines on its surface. As a result, the exoplanet has been described as \"black as asphalt\" and as \"pitch black.\""

        "description": "Proxima Centauri b (or Proxima b), also referred to as Alpha Centauri Cb, is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to the Sun and part of the larger triple star system Alpha Centauri. It is about 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation Centaurus, making it and Proxima d, along with the currently disputed Proxima c, the closest known exoplanets to the Solar System.\nProxima Centauri b orbits its parent star at a distance of about 0.04856 AU (7.264 million km; 4.514 million mi) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its other properties are only poorly understood as of 2024, but it is believed to be a potentially Earth-like planet with a minimum mass of at least 1.07 M\ud83d\udf28 and only a slightly larger radius than that of Earth. The planet orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star; but it is not known whether it has an atmosphere, which would impact the habitability probabilities. Proxima Centauri is a flare star with intense emission of electromagnetic radiation that could strip an atmosphere off the planet. The exoplanet's proximity to Earth offers an opportunity for robotic space exploration.\nAnnounced on 24 August 2016 by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), Proxima Centauri b was confirmed via several years of using the method of studying the radial velocity of its parent star. Furthermore, the discovery of Proxima Centauri b, a planet at habitable distances from the closest star to the Solar System, was a major discovery in planetology, and has drawn interest to the Alpha Centauri star system as a whole, of which Proxima itself is a member. As of 2023, Proxima Centauri b is believed to be the best-known exoplanet to the general public.\n\n"

It was announced on June 13, 2016, in San Diego at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. It was detected using the transit method, when it caused the dimming of the primary star, and then again of the secondary star blended with the primary star eclipse.\nThe first transit of the planet was identified in 2012, but at the time the single event was not enough to rule out contamination, or confirm it as a planet. It was discovered by the analysis of the Kepler light-curve, which showed the planet in transit."

        "description": "GQ Lupi b, or GQ Lupi B, is a possible extrasolar planet, brown dwarf or sub-brown dwarf orbiting the star GQ Lupi.  Its discovery was announced in April 2005, less than a month before the full confirmation of 2M1207b was announced.  Along with 2M1207b, this was one of the first extrasolar planet candidates to be directly imaged. The image was made with the European Southern Observatory's VLT telescope at the Paranal Observatory, Chile on June 25, 2004. \n\n GQ Lupi b has a spectral type between M6 and L0, corresponding to a temperature between 2,050 and 2,650 kelvins.  Located at a projected distance of about 100 AU from its companion star, giving it an orbital period of perhaps about 1,200 years, it is believed to be several times more massive than Jupiter.  Because the theoretical models which are used to predict planetary masses for objects in young star systems like GQ Lupi b are still tentative, the mass cannot be precisely specified \u2014 models place GQ Lupi b's mass anywhere between a few Jupiter masses and 36 Jupiter masses.  At the highest end of this range, GQ Lupi b could be classified as a small brown dwarf, but at the lowest end of this range, it could be classified as an extremely large Jupiter-like exoplanet rather than a brown dwarf. \nAs of 2006, the International Astronomical Union  Working Group on Extrasolar Planets described GQ Lupi b as a \"possible planetary-mass companion to a young star.\" GQ Lupi b is listed as a \"confirmed planet\" as of 2020.\n\n"

        "description": "HAT-P-12b, formally named Puli, is an extrasolar planet approximately 468 light years away from Earth, orbiting the 13th magnitude K-type star HAT-P-12, which is located in Canes Venatici constellation. It is a transiting hot Jupiter that was discovered by the HATNet Project on April 29, 2009.\nHAT-P-12b is a H/He-dominated gas giant planet with a core mass of 11.3+2.6\u22122.1 M\ud83d\udf28 and is moderately irradiated by its low-metallicity host star. Therefore, HAT-P-12b is most likely an H/He-dominated planet with a core of perhaps ~10 M\ud83d\udf28, and a total metal fraction of ~15%. This makes HAT-P-12b the least massive H/He-dominated gas giant planet found to date; the previous record holder was Saturn.\nIn 2020, the obtained transmission spectra have revealed that the atmosphere of HAT-P-12b is cloudy, with haze above cloud tops. Water was detected. The prevalence of clouds and hazes in planetary atmosphere was disputed in 2021 though.\nIn August 2022, this planet and its host star were included among 20 systems to be named by the third NameExoWorlds project. The approved names, proposed by a team from Hungary, were announced in June 2023. HAT-P-12b is named Puli and its host star is named Komondor, after the Hungarian Puli and Komondor dog breeds."

        "description": "Kepler-438b (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-3284.01) is a confirmed near-Earth-sized exoplanet. It is likely rocky. It orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone of a red dwarf, Kepler-438, about 460.2 light-years  from Earth in the constellation Lyra. It receives 1.4 times our solar flux. The planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. NASA announced the confirmation of the exoplanet on 6 January 2015.\n\n"

        "description": "MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, occasionally shortened to MOA-192 b, is an extrasolar planet approximately 7,000 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius. The planet was discovered orbiting the low-mass star MOA-2007-BLG-192L. It was found when it caused a gravitational microlensing event on May 24, 2007, which was detected as part of the MOA-II microlensing survey at the Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand.\nThe mass of the planet is not well-known. It is anything between 2.75 and 105 Earth masses (ME), although it is more likely to be between 3 and 12 ME. The mass range also means that the planet's classification varies, from a Super-Earth to a Sub-Saturn. It is located at 2.02 astronomical units from its host star.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-571.05) is an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Kepler-186, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope. It is located about 580 light-years (180 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\nKepler-186f orbits its star at a distance of about 0.43 AU (64,000,000 km; 40,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 130 days, and a mass and radius around 1.44 and 1.17 times that of Earth, respectively. As one of the more promising candidates for habitability, it was the first planet with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star. However, key components still need to be found to determine its habitability for life, including an atmosphere and its composition and if liquid water can exist on its surface.\nAnalysis of three years of data was required to find its signal. NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope detected it using the transit method (in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured), along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth).  The results were presented initially at a conference on 19 March 2014 and some details were reported in the media at the time. The planet was announced on 17 April 2014, simultaneously with publication of a scientific paper in Science.\n\n"

        "description": "HD 190007, also known as Gliese 775, is a star with a close orbiting exoplanet in the constellation of Aquila. Parallax measurements by Gaia put the star at a distance of 41.5 light-years (12.7 parsecs) away from the Sun. It is drifting closer with a radial velocity of \u221230.3 km/s, and is predicted to come within 11.8 light-years in 375,000 years. The star has an absolute magnitude of 6.91, but at its present distance the apparent visual magnitude is 7.46, which is too faint to be viewed with the naked eye.\nThe variability of the brightness of HD 190007 was discovered by George Wesley Lockwood et al. from data taken during a photometry program at Lowell Observatory carried out from 1984 through 1995. It was given its variable star designation, V1654 Aquilae, in 1997.\nThe spectrum of HD 190007 matches a K-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of K5 V. It is classified as a BY Draconis variable, showing a moderate level of magnetic activity in its chromosphere with a suspected activity cycle lasting 13.7 years. The star displays a mild enhancement of metals and its age is uncertain. It has 77% of the mass of the Sun, 80% of the Sun's radius, and is spinning with a rotation period of 28.6 days. HD 190007 is radiating 24% of the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,610 K."

This star is close enough to the Earth that its distance can be measured using the parallax technique, which yields a value of roughly 392 light-years (120 parsecs).\n\nIt is an evolved giant star of the spectral type K2 III. It has double the mass of the Sun and has expanded to 30 times the Sun's radius. Tau Geminorum is radiating 364 times \nas much radiation as the Sun from its expanded outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,583 K, giving it the characteristic orange-hued glow of a K-type star. It appears to be rotating slowly with a projected rotational velocity of 5.8 km/s."

It is the third planet discovered in the system (fourth if the disputed planet candidate Gliese 581d is included) and the first in order from the star.\nThe planet was discovered by an Observatory of Geneva team led by Michel Mayor, using the HARPS instrument on the European Southern Observatory 3.6 m (140 in) telescope in La Silla, Chile. The discovery was announced on 21 April 2009. Mayor's team employed the radial velocity technique, in which the orbit size and mass of a planet are determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star's orbit via gravity.\nWith a minimum mass of about 1.9 Earth masses, Gliese 581e was the least massive exoplanet known around a normal star at the time of discovery in 2009, with only PSR B1257+12 A being less massive. A 2024 study determined the orbital inclination of the planet, allowing its true mass to be determined, which is about 30% greater than the minimum mass at about 2.5 Earth masses.\nGliese 581e completes an orbit around its parent star in 3.15 days. At an orbital distance of just 0.028 AU (4,200,000 km) from its parent star, it orbits further in than the habitable zone. Although scientists think it probably has a rocky surface similar to Earth, it is also likely to experience intense tidal heating similar to (and likely more intense than) that affecting Jupiter's moon Io.\n\n"

The transit of this planet lasts 8 hours. The planet is at a distance from its star where there is a strong increase in albedo as the temperature decreases, because of the condensation of reflective water clouds in the atmosphere. This suggests its atmosphere may be locked into one of two states: a cloudless state with temperatures between 380 K (107 \u00b0C; 224 \u00b0F) and 430 K (157 \u00b0C; 314 \u00b0F), or covered in water clouds with a temperature in the range 250 K (\u221223 \u00b0C; \u221210 \u00b0F) to 290 K (17 \u00b0C; 62 \u00b0F).\n\n"

The galaxy NGC 404, also known as Mirach's Ghost, is seven arcminutes away from Mirach.\nThis star has an apparent visual magnitude of around 2.07, varying between 2.01 and 2.10, which at times makes it the brightest star in the constellation.  Based upon parallax measurements, it is roughly 197 light-years (60 parsecs) from the Sun. Its apparent magnitude is reduced by 0.06 by extinction due to gas and dust along the line of sight. The star has a negligible radial velocity of 0.1 km/s, but with a relatively large proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at 0.208\u2033\u00b7yr\u22121."

Subsequent readings filtered out the star's rotation, giving a more accurate reading of the planet's orbit and minimum mass.\nThe planet orbits inside the inner magnetosphere of its star. The quoted temperature of 450 K is a \"thermal equilibrium\" temperature.\nIt is projected to be dominated by a rocky core, but the true mass is unknown. If the orbit is oriented such that we are viewing it at a nearly face-on angle, the planet may be significantly more massive than the lower limit. If so, it may have attracted a gas envelope like Uranus or Gliese 436 b.\n\n"

A very massive and dense planet with a minimum mass of 10.3 MJ, it was discovered on February 19, 2008, by Bun'ei Sato.\nIn July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the name Arion for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Tokushima Prefectural Jonan High School Science Club of Japan. Arion was a genius of poetry and music in ancient Greece. According to legend, his life was saved at sea by dolphins after attracting their attention by the playing of his kithara ('Delphinus' is Latin for 'dolphin').\n\n"

It is a faint star but visible to the naked eye on a dark night with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.53. The annual parallax shift of the star as seen from Earth is 12.08 mas, which provides a distance estimate of around 270 light years. It is moving closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of \u221254 km/s.\nBased upon the spectrum of this star, it has a stellar classification of K0 III. This indicates this is an evolved K-type giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and has left the main sequence. This is a red clump star, which means it is now generating energy through helium fusion at its core. It has 107% of the mass of the Sun and has expanded to over ten times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating 50 times the Sun's luminosity from its expanded photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,812 K."

        "description": "OGLE-TR-111b is an extrasolar planet approximately 5,000 light-years away in the constellation of Carina (the Keel).  The planet is currently the only confirmed planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-111 (though a possible second planet is plausible).\nIn 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey detected that the light from the star periodically dimmed very slightly every 4 days, indicating a planet-sized body transiting the star. But since the mass of the object had not been measured, it was not clear that it was a true planet, low-mass red dwarf or something else.\nIn 2004 radial velocity measurements showed unambiguously that the transiting body is indeed a planet.\nThe planet is probably very similar to the other hot Jupiters orbiting nearby stars. Its mass is about half that of Jupiter and it orbits the star at a distance less than 1/20th that of Earth from the Sun.\nOGLE-TR-111b has similar mass and orbital distance as the first transiting planet, HD 209458 b (Osiris).  But unlike it, the planet has a radius comparable to Jupiter which is typical to other transiting planets detected by OGLE. However, those other planets tend to be more massive and orbit even closer than typical hot Jupiters.  Therefore, this planet is an important \"missing link\" between the different types of transiting planets.\n\n"

        "description": "HD 179949 b, formally named Mastika, is an extrasolar planet discovered by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search at the Anglo-Australian Observatory, which orbits the star HD 179949. The planet is a so-called \"hot Jupiter\", a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting very close to its parent star. In this case, orbital distance is almost one-tenth that of Mercury from the Sun. One orbital revolution lasts only about 3 days.\nIts magnetic field induces a bright spot on its star at 30 degrees latitude, which rotates at 87 degrees inclination. If the planet orbited at 83-97 degrees, then its transit would be visible from Earth. The angle of inclination is therefore 83 degrees or less, but not much less; and its mass is about 0.92 Jupiter masses MJ. The star is not tidally locked to the planet.\nAssuming the planet is perfectly grey with no greenhouse or tidal effects, and a Bond albedo of 0.1, the temperature would be 1533 K.  This is, like Tau Bo\u00f6tis b, hotter than the predicted temperature of HD 209458 b (1392K), and close to that of HD 149026 b, before they were measured.\nSearches for water in the planet's atmosphere have been inconclusive at first, as have attempts to determine whether titanium and vanadium oxides are present. In the meantime, both carbon monoxide and water have been found in the dayside emission of HD 179949b.\nHD 179949 b is a candidate for \"near-infrared characterisation.... with the VLTI Spectro-Imager\".\nThe light reflected off planet could not be detected as in 2021, implying HD 179949 b has a low albedo.\nThe planet HD 179949 b is named Mastika. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Brunei, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Mastika is a Malay word, which means a gem, precious stone, jewel or the prettiest, the most beautiful."

        "description": "HR 858 (also known as HD 17926 or TOI-396) is a star with a planetary system located 103 light-years from the Sun in the southern constellation of Fornax. It has a yellow-white hue and is visible to the naked eye, but it is a challenge to see with an apparent visual magnitude of 6.4. The star is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 10 km/s. It has an absolute magnitude of +3.82.\nThis object is a slightly-evolved F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F6V, which indicates it is generating energy through core hydrogen fusion. It is roughly two billion years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 8.3 km/s. The star has 1.1 times the mass of the Sun and 1.3 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 2.3 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,201 K.\nA faint co-moving stellar companion, designated component B, at an angular separation of 8.4\u2033. This corresponds to a projected separation of 270 AU. It is a red dwarf star.\n\n"

It shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.13, meaning it is visible to the unaided eye in all night skies except those brightly lit in inner city locations. It is an orange giant around 1.7 times as massive as the Sun of spectral type K2III, which has exhausted its core fuel supply of hydrogen and swollen to 22 times the Sun's diameter and 163 times its luminosity. That is, Epsilon Coronae Borealis's diameter is about one-quarter of Mercury's orbit. Its surface temperature has been calculated to be 4,365\u00b19 K, 4,408\u00b1109 K, or 4,406\u00b115 K. It is thought to be around 3.2 billion years old.\nEpsilon Coronae Borealis B is a companion star thought to be an orange dwarf of spectral types K3V to K9V that orbits at a distance of 135 astronomical units, completing one orbit every 900 years.\nA faint (magnitude 11.5) star, 1.5 arc minutes away, has been called Epsilon Coronae Borealis C although it is only close by line of sight and is unrelated to the system.\nEpsilon Coronae Borealis lies one degree north of (and is used as a guide for) the variable T Coronae Borealis.\n\n"

The distance to this system is approximately 1,590 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 25.39 km/s. In 2005, a planetary companion or brown dwarf was announced in orbit around this star.\nIt has a spectral classification of K1II-III, making it a giant star that has evolved away from the main sequence after exhausting the hydrogen at its core. The mass is 1.2 times the Sun's, while measurements of the star's radius give estimates of 38 R\u2609. The atmosphere of the star displays short period radial velocity variations with a primary period of 4.89 days. This behavior is typical for giant K-type stars such as this and it is not the result of a close-orbit planetary companion."

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets transiting their stars.\nThe star hosts three confirmed planets and a likely fourth, including the lowest-mass exoplanet with a measured mass and size discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars.  Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf, more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.\n\n"

        "description": "11 Comae Berenices is a binary star system in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices, located in the sky, east and slightly north of Denebola in Leo, but not nearly as far east as \u03b5 Virginis in Virgo. It is about a degree from the elliptical galaxy M85 and two degrees north of the spiral galaxy M100. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 10.7104 mas, the star is located 305 light years away from the Sun. It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.72. This body is moving away from the Sun with a heliocentric radial velocity of +44 km/s.\nThe primary component is an aging K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It is a low metallicity star with an iron abundance about half that of the Sun. Keenan and McNeil (1989) found a class of G8+ III Fe-1, showing an underabundance of iron in the spectrum. At the age of  1.5 billion years old with 1.7 times the mass of the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and expanded to 15.8 times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating 110 times the luminosity of the Sun from its swollen photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,670 K. It has a magnitude 12.9 companion star at an angular separation of 8.8\u2033 along a position angle of 44\u00b0, as of 2007."

        "description": "Kepler-452b (sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earth's Cousin based on its characteristics; also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-7016.01) is a candidate super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the inner edge of the habitable zone of the sun-like star Kepler-452 and is the only planet in the system discovered by the Kepler space telescope. It is located about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\nKepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 385 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.5 times that of Earth. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very Sun-like star. However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy from its star than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.\nThe Kepler space telescope identified the exoplanet, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015. The planet is about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New Horizons spacecraft, at about 59,000 km/h (16,000 m/s; 37,000 mph), it would take approximately 30 million years to get there.\n\n"

Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004 the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet.\nThe planet has a mass 1.14 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, this represents the best measured true mass of the planet, rather than simply the minimum mass as is the case when the inclination is unknown. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-132) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1 day 16.6 hours. The radius of the planet is only 18% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \"super-hot Jupiters\"."

        "description": "OGLE-TR-10b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-10.\nThe planet was first detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey in 2002. The star, OGLE-TR-10, was seen dimming by a tiny amount every three days. The transit lightcurve resembles that of HD 209458 b, the first transiting extrasolar planet. However, the mass of the object had to be measured by the radial velocity method because other objects like red dwarfs and brown dwarfs can mimic the planetary transit. In late 2004 it was confirmed as the fifth planetary discovery by OGLE.\nThe planet is a typical \"hot Jupiter\", a planet with a mass half that of Jupiter and orbital distance only 1/24 that of Earth from the Sun. One revolution around the star takes a little over three days to complete. The planet is slightly larger than Jupiter, probably due to the heat from the star.\nOGLE-TR-10 was identified as a promising candidate by the OGLE team during their 2001 campaign in three fields towards the Galactic Center.\nThe possible planetary nature of its companion was based on spectroscopic follow-up.\nA reported a tentative radial velocity semi-amplitude (from Keck-I/HIRES) of 100\u00b143 m/s, and a mass for the putative planet of 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 MJup was confirmed in 2004 with the UVES/FLAMES radial velocities. However, the possibility of a blend could not be ruled out.\nA blend scenario as an alternative explanation from an analysis combining all available radial velocity measurements with the OGLE light curve. OGLE-TR-10b has a mass of 0.57 \u00b1 0.12 MJup and a radius of 1.24 \u00b1 0.09 RJup. These parameters bear close resemblance to those of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD 209458 b.\nThe planets with the longer periods in the hot Jupiter class all have small masses (~0.7 MJup), while all the short-period planets (i.e., very hot Jupiters) have masses roughly twice as large. This trend may be related to the survival of planets in proximity to their parent stars."

This star is invisible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 8.45. It is located at a distance of 128 light years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting closer with a radial velocity of \u221217 km/s.\n\nThe stellar classification of HD 203030 is K0V, indicating this is a K-type main-sequence star. It is likely very young, belonging to the 45 million years old IC 2391 open cluster. Based on photometric measurements by Hipparcos, it was found to exhibit low amplitude periodic variability with a range of 0.0139 in magnitude and a period of 4.14 days. However the General Catalog of Variable Stars lists its period as 6.664 days. It is now classified as a chromospherically active BY Draconis variable.

Despite this, and being relatively close by, it is very dim (as are all red dwarfs), being only magnitude 7.5 in visible light and thus too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. The star is visible through a small telescope or binoculars.\nAt 8.304 light-years (2.546 parsecs) away it is one of the stars nearest to the Solar System; only the Alpha Centauri system, Barnard's Star, Wolf 359, and the brown dwarfs Luhman 16 and WISE 0855\u22120714 are known to be closer. Because of its proximity it is a frequent subject for astronomical surveys and other research and thus is known by numerous other designations, most commonly Gliese 411 and HD 95735. In approximately 19,900 years it will be at its closest, about 4.65 ly (1.43 pc) from the Sun, just over half its present distance.\nLalande 21185 has two known exoplanets and one candidate exoplanet, making it the third closest confirmed planetary system to the Solar System.\n\n"

        "description": "OGLE-TR-10b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-10.\nThe planet was first detected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey in 2002. The star, OGLE-TR-10, was seen dimming by a tiny amount every three days. The transit lightcurve resembles that of HD 209458 b, the first transiting extrasolar planet. However, the mass of the object had to be measured by the radial velocity method because other objects like red dwarfs and brown dwarfs can mimic the planetary transit. In late 2004 it was confirmed as the fifth planetary discovery by OGLE.\nThe planet is a typical \"hot Jupiter\", a planet with a mass half that of Jupiter and orbital distance only 1/24 that of Earth from the Sun. One revolution around the star takes a little over three days to complete. The planet is slightly larger than Jupiter, probably due to the heat from the star.\nOGLE-TR-10 was identified as a promising candidate by the OGLE team during their 2001 campaign in three fields towards the Galactic Center.\nThe possible planetary nature of its companion was based on spectroscopic follow-up.\nA reported a tentative radial velocity semi-amplitude (from Keck-I/HIRES) of 100\u00b143 m/s, and a mass for the putative planet of 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 MJup was confirmed in 2004 with the UVES/FLAMES radial velocities. However, the possibility of a blend could not be ruled out.\nA blend scenario as an alternative explanation from an analysis combining all available radial velocity measurements with the OGLE light curve. OGLE-TR-10b has a mass of 0.57 \u00b1 0.12 MJup and a radius of 1.24 \u00b1 0.09 RJup. These parameters bear close resemblance to those of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD 209458 b.\nThe planets with the longer periods in the hot Jupiter class all have small masses (~0.7 MJup), while all the short-period planets (i.e., very hot Jupiters) have masses roughly twice as large. This trend may be related to the survival of planets in proximity to their parent stars."

        "description": "WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter (a class of extrasolar planets) orbiting the star WASP-12, discovered in April of 2008, by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey. The planet takes only a little over one Earth day to orbit its star, in contrast to about 365.25 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun. Its distance from the star (approximately 3.5 million kilometers [2.2 million miles; 0.023 astronomical units]) is only \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              43\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\frac {1}{43}}}\n  \n the Earth's distance from the Sun, with an eccentricity the same as Jupiter's. Consequently, it has one of the lowest densities for exoplanets (\"inflated\" by the flux of energy from the star). On December 3, 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) reported detecting water in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. In July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-12b) orbiting sun-like stars.\nIn September 2017, researchers working on the HST announced that WASP-12b reflects just 6% of the light that shines on its surface. As a result, the exoplanet has been described as \"black as asphalt\" and as \"pitch black.\""

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

The planet is a sub-Neptune about 2.6 times the radius of Earth, with a 33-day orbit within the star's habitable zone. This means it receives about a similar amount of starlight as the Earth receives from the Sun. Initially discovered with the Kepler space telescope, it was later observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in order to study the planet's atmosphere.\nIn 2019 the presence of water vapour in K2-18b's atmosphere was reported, drawing attention to this system. In 2023, the JWST detected carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere of K2-18b. JWST\u2019s data has been variously interpreted as indicating a water ocean planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, and a gas-rich mini-Neptune. K2-18b has been studied as a potential habitable world that, temperature aside, more closely resembles a gas planet like Uranus or Neptune than Earth."

        "description": "WASP-17b, officially named Dits\u00f6\u0300, is an exoplanet in the constellation Scorpius that is orbiting the star WASP-17. Its discovery was announced on 11 August 2009. It is the first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in a direction counter to the rotation of its host star. This discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory. In terms of diameter, WASP-17b is one of the largest exoplanets discovered and at half Jupiter's mass, this made it the most puffy planet known in 2010. On 3 December 2013, scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope reported detecting water in the exoplanet's atmosphere.\nWASP-17b's name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Costa Rica, during the 100th anniversary of the International Astronomical Union. Dits\u00f6\u0300 is the name that the god Sib\u00f6\u0300 gave to the first Bribri people in Talamancan mythology."

        "description": "HAT-P-3b, also named Teberda, is an extrasolar planet that orbits the star HAT-P-3 approximately 450 light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major. It was discovered by the HATNet Project via the transit method and confirmed with Doppler spectroscopy, so both its mass and radius are known quite precisely. Based on these figures it is predicted that the planet has about 75 Earth masses' worth of heavy elements in its core, making it similar to the planet HD 149026 b.\nThe planet HAT-P-3b is named Teberda. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Russia, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Teberda is a mountain river in Dombay region (name of HAT-P-3).\nIn 2013, this planet was photometrically observed by Spitzer Space Telescope which characterized its near-zero eccentricity and low albedo.\n\n"

        "description": "HD 189733 b is an exoplanet in the constellation of Vulpecula approximately 64.5 light-years (19.8 parsecs) away from the Solar System. Astronomers in France discovered the planet orbiting the star HD 189733 on October 5, 2005, by observing its transit across the star's face. With a mass 11.2% higher than that of Jupiter and a radius 11.4% greater, HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.0 kilometers per second (152,000 meters per second; 340,000 miles per hour), making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for extraterrestrial life.\nThe closest transiting hot Jupiter to Earth, HD 189733 b has been the subject of close atmospheric observation. Scientists have studied it with high- and low-resolution instruments, both from the ground and from space. Researchers have found that the planet's weather includes raining molten glass. HD 189733 b was also the first exoplanet to have its thermal map constructed, possibly to be detected through polarimetry, its overall color determined (deep blue), its transit viewed in the X-ray spectrum, and to have carbon dioxide confirmed as being present in its atmosphere.\nIn July 2014, NASA announced the discovery of very dry atmospheres on three exoplanets that orbited Sun-like stars: HD 189733 b, HD 209458 b, and WASP-12b.\n\n"

This zone receives strong irradiation from the star, meaning the planets cannot retain their gaseous atmospheres: They evaporate, leaving just a rocky core.\nNeptune-sized planets should be easier to find in short-period orbits, and many sufficiently massive planets have been discovered with longer orbits from surveys such as CoRoT and Kepler. The physical mechanisms that result in the observed Neptunian desert are currently unknown, but have been suggested to be due to a different formation mechanism for short-period super-Earth and Jovian exoplanets, similar to the reasons for the brown-dwarf desert."

The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-quarters of the size of Jupiter. This low relative mass might be caused by a core that is of low mass or that is not present at all.\nThe planet orbits at approximately 5% of the distance between the Sun and Earth every four days. The star was observed several times between 2006 and 2009, at first through the SuperWASP program and later through focused follow-up observations. Analysis of collected radial velocity measurements led to the discovery of Cruinlagh, which was reported in a journal on April 7, 2009. A follow-up study published in 2011 investigated the cause for inflated planets such as Cruinlagh, and re-examined (and re-constrained) its mass, radius, density, and age."

Since the inclination is known by transit observation, the true mass is known. The secondary eclipse where the planet passes behind the star was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope leading to the discovery that the planet has inefficient heat transfer from its day to night side.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -4.9\u00b111.9\u00b0.\n\n"

Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf, more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.\n\n"

It completes an orbit every 118 days, placing it much further from its star than the system's inner five planets. Its estimated radius is a little over three times that of Earth, i.e. comparable to Neptune's size.  Kepler-11g's distance from the inner planets made its confirmation more difficult than that of the inner planets, as scientists had to work to exhaustively disprove all reasonable alternatives before Kepler-11g could be confirmed. The planet's discovery, along with that of the other Kepler-11 planets, was announced on February 2, 2011. According to NASA, the Kepler-11 planets form the flattest and most compact system yet discovered."

WASP-43b was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program, before they conducted follow-ups using instruments at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which confirmed its existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics. The planet's discovery was published on April 14, 2011.\nWASP-43b has an orbital period of approximately 0.8 days (19.2 hours), which at the time of discovery was the second-shortest known, surpassed only by WASP-19b. At the time of its discovery, the size of WASP-43b's orbit was the smallest known for a hot Jupiter, probably due to its host star's low mass."

The planet has a mass half that of Jupiter, but its insolation has forced a thermal expansion of its radius to greater than that of Jupiter. Thus, this planet is an inflated hot Jupiter.

This process, known as the transit method, was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around Kepler-11, of which Kepler-11d is the third from its star. Kepler-11d orbits Kepler-11 well within the orbit of Mercury approximately every 23 days. The planet is approximately six times more massive than the Earth, and has a radius that is three and a half times larger than that of Earth's. It is, however, far hotter than Earth is. Its low density, comparable to that of Saturn, suggests that Kepler-11d has a large hydrogen\u2013helium atmosphere. Kepler-11d was announced with its five sister planets on February 2, 2011 after extensive follow-up studies."

Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "WASP-19b, formally named Banksia, is an exoplanet, notable for possessing one of the shortest orbital periods of any known planetary body: 0.79 days or approximately 18.932 hours.\nIt has a mass close to that of Jupiter (1.15 Jupiter masses), but by comparison has a much larger radius (1.31 times that of Jupiter, or 0.13 Solar radii); making it nearly the size of a low-mass star. It orbits the star WASP-19 in the Vela constellation. At the time of discovery it was the shortest period hot Jupiter discovered as planets with shorter orbital periods had a rocky, or metallic composition.\nA study in 2012, utilizing the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, determined the planetary orbit is well aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to -15\u00b111\u00b0.\nIn 2013, secondary eclipse and orbital phases were barely observed from the data gathered with ASTEP telescope, making it the first detection of such kind through ground-based observations. This was possible due to the large size of the planet and its small semi-major axis.\nIn 2019 the planet was observed with TESS and the eclipse of the planet was measured. The broad variations caused by the changing aspect of the heated face of the planet were measured. The study deduced that the dayside has a temperature of 2240 \u00b1 40 K (1967 \u00b1 40 \u00b0C) and that the planet reflects 16 \u00b1 4 percent of the light that falls on it. The last value is relatively high compared to other planets.\nDespite the short orbital period, orbital decay of WASP-19b was not detected as of 2019."

It was discovered via the transit method by SuperWASP, and follow up radial velocity observations confirmed that WASP-3b is a planet. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a similar bulk composition to Jupiter. WASP-3b has such an orbital distance around its star to classify it in the class of planets known as hot Jupiters and has an atmospheric temperature of approximately 1983 K.\nWASP-3b undergoes no detectable gravitational tugging from other bodies in this system.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to 3.3+2.5\u22124.4\u00b0."

Initially discovered by Kepler space telescope, a terrestrial planet-searching satellite built and operated by NASA, Kepler-9d is most likely a Super-Earth, with an estimated radius approximately 60% larger than that of Earth's, although its exact mass cannot be determined. Kepler-9d orbits Kepler-9 every 1.56 days at a distance of .0273 AU from its star, an extremely close distance. Although Kepler-9d is the closest planet to its star in its system, it is named Kepler-9d instead of Kepler-9b because two gas giants, Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, were confirmed first. The original studies into the system first suggested that Kepler-9d might be a planet, but a follow-up investigation made by the Kepler team later confirmed that it was; the confirmation of Kepler-9d as a planet was made public with the team's paper, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. The team used telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to follow up on the Kepler space telescope's initial discovery."

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

On 27 January 2015, the Kepler spacecraft is reported to have confirmed the detection of five sub-Earth-sized rocky exoplanets orbiting the main star. The star is a K-type main sequence star. All of the planets are far too close to their star to harbour life forms.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-10c is an exoplanet orbiting the G-type star Kepler-10, located around 608 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by the Kepler space telescope team in May 2011, although it had been seen as a planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called BLENDER that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.\nKepler-10c orbits its host star every forty-five days at a quarter of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. Initial observations showed that it has a radius more than double that of Earth, and suggested a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5\u201320% ices by mass. For comparison, the Earth's oceans represent only 0.02% of our planet's mass, with an additional amount potentially a few times this stored in the mantle.  However, in 2017, more careful analysis using both HARPS and HIRES data revealed that Kepler-10c is not a large terrestrial planet, but instead a typical volatile-rich planet of about seven Earth masses."

        "description": "Kepler-9c is one of the first seven extrasolar planets, exoplanets, discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, and one of at least two planets orbiting the star Kepler-9. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were the first exoplanets confirmed to be transiting their star. The planet's discovery was announced by the Kepler Mission team on August 26, 2010 after its initial discovery by Kepler. At the time, it was one of 700 planetary candidates noted by Kepler.\nObservations of the planet have suggested that it is a hydrogen\u2013helium gas giant that is slightly smaller than Saturn, and that it orbits nearby its star at .225 AU. Kepler-9c and b are notable in that the planets share a pattern of orbital resonance, in which the orbit of each planet stabilizes the orbit of the other. During the time it was observed by the spacecraft, the planet's orbit, which lasts on average approximately 38 days, shortened by 39 minutes every orbital period because of this effect. Its orbit, over time, oscillates slightly above and below a 2:1 ratio with planet b.\n\n"

It is located about 2,430 light-years (746 parsecs) from Earth.\nKepler-69c orbits its star at a distance of 0.64 AU (96,000,000 km; 59,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 242.46 days, has a mass at least 2.14 times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.7 times that of Earth. Initial findings found that it could possibly be habitable, however updated analysis shows that Kepler-69c resides outside of the inner edge of the habitable zone, and thus is highly likely to resemble the planet Venus with temperatures and conditions far too hot to sustain any life, making it uninhabitable.\nThe discovery of the exoplanet was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler spacecraft data release. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.\n\n"

It was discovered by the Kepler telescope in October 2013. It orbits its parent star only 0.17 AU (16 million mi; 25 million km) away; at its distance, it completes an orbit once every 21.4 days. Its orbit is significantly misaligned with its parent star's equator. Further studies have revealed that a third planet, 56d, is responsible for misaligning the orbits of both planets.\nBoth Kepler-56b and Kepler-56c will be devoured by their parent star in about 130 and 155 million years, respectively. Further research shows that it will have its atmosphere boiled away by intense heat from the star, and it will be stretched by the strengthening stellar tides."

        "description": "Kepler-62f (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.04) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the star Kepler-62, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope.  It is located about 982 light-years (301 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.\nKepler-62f orbits its parent star at a distance of 0.718 AU (107,400,000 km; 66,700,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 267 days, and has a radius of around 1.41 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is a relatively quiet star, and has less mass than the Sun \u2013 thus it can live up to a span of about 30 billion years or so. Based on its size, Kepler-62f is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet. However, key components of the exoplanet still need to be assessed to determine habitability; such as its atmosphere if one exists, since it lies within the outer part of its host star's habitable zone.\nThe discovery of the exoplanet\u2013along with Kepler-62e\u2013was announced in April 2013 by NASA as part of the Kepler space telescope data release. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. According to scientists, it is a potential candidate to search for extraterrestrial life, and was chosen as one of the targets to study by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program.\n\n"

The planet was identified in 2011 as the darkest known exoplanet, reflecting less than 1% of any light that hits it. Reflecting less light than charcoal, on the surface the planet is said to be pitch black. The planet's mass and radius indicate that it is a gas giant with a bulk composition similar to that of Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, but similar to many planets detected around other stars, TrES-2b is located very close to its star and belongs to the class of planets known as hot Jupiters. This system was within the field of view of the Kepler spacecraft.\nThis planet continues to be studied by other projects, and the parameters are continuously improving. A 2007 study improved stellar and planetary parameters. A 2008 study concluded that the TrES-2 system is a binary star system. This significantly affects the values for the stellar and the planetary parameters.\n\n"

The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at a conference in Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler."

        "description": "Kepler-11f is an exoplanet (extrasolar planet) discovered in the orbit of the Sun-like star Kepler-11 by NASA's Kepler space telescope, which searches for planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. Kepler-11f is the fifth planet from its star, orbiting one quarter of the distance (.25 AU) of the Earth from the Sun every 47 days. It is the furthest of the first five planets in the system. Kepler-11f is the least massive of Kepler-11's six planets, at nearly twice the mass of Earth; it is about 2.6 times the radius of Earth. Along with planets d and e and unlike the two inner planets in the system, Kepler-11f has a density lower than that of water and comparable to that of Saturn. This suggests that Kepler-11f has a significant hydrogen\u2013helium atmosphere. The Kepler-11 planets constitute the first system discovered with more than three transiting planets. Kepler-11f was announced to the public on February 2, 2011, after follow-up investigations at several observatories.  Analysis of the planets and study results were published the next day  in the journal Nature.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets.

Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter that is about half the mass of Jupiter, but is nearly 1.5 times its size; at the time of its discovery, Kepler-7b was the second most diffuse planet known, surpassed only by WASP-17b.  It orbits its host star every five days at a distance of approximately 0.06 AU (9,000,000 km; 5,600,000 mi). Kepler-7b was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. It is the first extrasolar planet to have a crude map of cloud coverage.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "HD 179070, also known as Kepler-21, is a star with a closely orbiting exoplanet in the northern constellation of Lyra. At an apparent visual magnitude of 8.25 this was the brightest star observed by the Kepler spacecraft to host a validated planet until the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting HD 212657 in 2018. This system is located at a distance of 354 light-years (109 parsecs) from the Sun based on parallax measurements, but is drifting closer with a radial velocity of \u221218.2 km/s.\n\nThe spectrum of HD 179070 presents as an evolving F-type subgiant star with a stellar classification of F6 IV. This suggests the star has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is evolving into a giant star. It is an estimated 2.6 billion years old and is spinning with a rotation period of 12.6 days. With 1.4 times the mass of the Sun it currently has 1.9 times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating five times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,305 K.\nA faint nearby source was detected in 2011 and determined to be a co-moving stellar companion in 2016. Designated HD 179070 B, it lies at an angular separation of 0.75\u2033 along a position angle of 129\u00b0 relative to the primary. At the distance of this star, this corresponds to a projected separation of 87 AU. It is possible that this companion star had a significant influence on the exoplanet formation and subsequent orbital evolution.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets.

        "description": "Kepler-11e is an exoplanet (extrasolar planet) discovered in the orbit of the sunlike star Kepler-11. It is the fourth of six planets around Kepler-11 discovered by NASA's Kepler space telescope. Kepler-11e was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Kepler-11e is most likely a gas giant like Neptune, having a density that is less than that of Saturn, the least dense planet in the Solar System. Its low density can probably be attributed to a large hydrogen and helium atmosphere.  Kepler-11e has a mass eight times of Earth's mass and a radius 4.5 times that of Earth. The planet orbits its star every 31 days in an ellipse that would fit within the orbit of Mercury. Kepler-11e was announced on February 2, 2011 with its five sister planets after it was confirmed by several observatories.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

The planet is second-closest to the star after Kepler-20b, and at 1,040 K (770 \u00b0C; 1,410 \u00b0F), it is far too hot to have liquid water on its surface. Along with the other four planets in the system, Kepler-20e was announced on 20 December 2011.\nKepler-20e is the first planet smaller than the Earth discovered to orbit a star other than the Sun. A year on Kepler-20e only lasts 6 days, as it is much closer to its host star than the Earth is to the Sun. The temperature at the surface of the planet, around 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, is much too hot to support life, as we know it.\nKepler-20e is likely to be entirely rocky and without an atmosphere. The planet is tidally locked, always showing the same side to its host star, as the Moon to the Earth, and could have large temperature differences between its permanent night and day sides.\nAstronomers think that the planet is likely to be geologically active, due to its own formation process and the strong gravitational interactions with its host star. In this artistic depiction, the planet is represented with active volcanoes on both the night and day sides."

        "description": "Kepler-6b is an extrasolar planet in the orbit of the unusually metal-rich Kepler-6, a star in the field of view of the NASA-operated Kepler spacecraft, which searches for planets that cross directly in front of, or transit, their host stars. It was the third planet to be discovered by Kepler. Kepler-6 orbits its host star every three days from a distance of .046 AU. Its proximity to Kepler-6 inflated the planet, about two-thirds the mass of Jupiter, to slightly larger than Jupiter's size and greatly heated its atmosphere.\nFollow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation, which was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010 along with four other Kepler-discovered planets.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-68c is an Earth-sized planet orbiting the star Kepler-68 in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by planetary-transit methods by the Kepler space telescope in February 2013. It has a mass of 4.8+2.5\u22123.6 times that of Earth (0.015 MJ) and a radius of 0.953+0.037\u22120.042 Earth radii. It has an orbital period of 9.605085 days at a distance of about 0.09059 AU from its star. Relatively wide constraints on Kepler-68c's mass are the result lack of detection of the planet through radial-velocity and transit-timing-variation methods.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-62e (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-701.03) is a super-Earth exoplanet (extrasolar planet) discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of Kepler-62, the second outermost of five such planets discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft.  Kepler-62e is located about 990 light-years (300 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Lyra.  The exoplanet was found using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Kepler-62e may be a terrestrial or ocean-covered planet; it lies in the inner part of its host star's habitable zone.\nKepler-62e orbits its host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger (in diameter) than Earth.\n\n"

Kepler-10b has a mass of 3.72\u00b10.42 Earth masses and a radius of 1.47 Earth radii. However, it lies extremely close to its star, Kepler-10, and as a result is too hot to support life as we know it. Its existence was confirmed using measurements from the W.M.

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "HD 209458 b is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus, some 157 light-years (48 parsecs) from the Solar System. The radius of the planet's orbit is 0.047 AU (7.0 million km; 4.4 million mi), or one-eighth the radius of Mercury's orbit (0.39 AU (36 million mi; 58 million km)). This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth-days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000 \u00b0C (1,800 \u00b0F; 1,300 K). Its mass is 220 times that of Earth (0.69 Jupiter masses) and its volume is some 2.5 times greater than that of Jupiter. The high mass and volume of HD 209458 b indicate that it is a gas giant.\nHD 209458 b represents a number of milestones in exoplanetary research. It was the first of many categories:\n\na transiting extrasolar planet\nThe first planet detected through more than one method\nan extrasolar planet known to have an atmosphere\nan extrasolar planet observed to have an evaporating hydrogen atmosphere\nan extrasolar planet found to have an atmosphere containing the elements oxygen and carbon\none of the first two extrasolar planets to be directly observed spectroscopically\nThe first extrasolar gas giant to have its superstorm measured\nthe first planet to have its orbital speed measured, determining its mass directly.\nBased on the application of newer theoretical models, as of April 2007, it is thought to be the first extrasolar planet found to have water vapor in its atmosphere.\nIn July 2014, NASA announced finding very dry atmospheres on HD 209458 b and two other exoplanets (HD 189733 b and WASP-12b) orbiting Sun-like stars.\nHD 209458 b has been nicknamed \"Osiris\" after the Egyptian god. This nickname has been acknowledged by the IAU, but as of 2023 it has not yet been approved as an official proper name.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

It is located about 2,840 light-years (870 parsecs, or nearly 2.4078\u00d71016 km) from Earth in the constellation Draco. The exoplanet is the eighth in the star's multiplanetary system. As of December 2017, Kepler-90 is the star hosting the most exoplanets found. Kepler-90i was found with the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured, and by a newly utilized computer tool, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf, more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "HAT-P-8b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 720 light years away in the constellation of Pegasus, orbiting the 10th magnitude star GSC 02757-01152. This planet was discovered by transit on December 5, 2008. Despite the designation as HAT-P-8b, it is the 11th planet discovered by the HATNet Project. The mass of the planet is 50% more than Jupiter while the radius is also 50% more than Jupiter. The mass of this planet is exact since the inclination of the orbit is known, typical for transiting planets. This is a so-called \u201chot Jupiter\u201d because this Jupiter-like gas giant planet orbits in a really close torch orbit around the star, making this planet extremely hot (in the order of a thousand kelvins). The distance from the star is roughly 20 times smaller than that of Earth from the Sun, which places the planet roughly 8 times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.  The \u201cyear\u201d on this planet lasts only 3 days, 1 hour, 49 minutes, and 54 seconds, compared with Earth's 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 10 seconds in a sidereal year.\nThe study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is mildly misaligned with the rotational axis of the star, misalignment equal to -17+9.2\u221211.5\u00b0.\n\n"

        "description": "HAT-P-6b is a transiting extrasolar planet discovered by Noyes et al. on October 15, 2007. It is located approximately 910 light-years away in the constellation of Andromeda, orbiting the star HAT-P-6. This hot Jupiter planet orbits with a semi-major axis of about 0.05 AU, and takes 92 hours, 28 minutes, 17 seconds to orbit the star. It has true mass of 5.7% greater than Jupiter and a radius 33% greater than Jupiter, corresponding to a density of 0.583 g/cm3, which is less than water.\nThe planet HAT-P-6b is named Nachtwacht. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by the Netherlands, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU, after Rembrandt's painting The Night Watch.\nThe sky projected angle between stellar and orbital axis is roughly 166\u00b0, making it one of the few planets that is in a retrograde orbit around its parent star. Observations made by Spitzer Space Telescope shows that the planet atmosphere has a weak temperature inversion, or no inversion at all, depending on how strong is the stellar chromospheric activity.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

Negoiu is the second highest peak in Romania.\nIn 2006, the XO Project, an international team of professional and amateur astronomers, discovered a Jupiter-sized planet, later named XO-1b, orbiting a Sun-like star. The team, led by Peter R. McCullough of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, had four amateur astronomers hailing from North America and Europe. An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.\nThe XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.\nFrom September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it. McCullough's team then turned to the McDonald Observatory in Texas for information on the object's mass and to confirm it was a planet."

On 27 January 2015, the Kepler spacecraft is reported to have confirmed the detection of five sub-Earth-sized rocky exoplanets orbiting the main star. The star is a K-type main sequence star.

        "description": "Kepler-22b (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-087.01) is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22.  It is located about 640 light-years (200 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in December 2011 and was the first known transiting planet to orbit within the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. Kepler-22 is too dim to be seen with the naked eye.\nKepler-22b's radius is roughly twice that of Earth. Its mass and surface composition are unknown. However, an Earth-like composition for the planet has been ruled out; it is likely to have a volatile-rich composition with a liquid or gaseous outer shell. The only parameters of the planet's orbit that are currently available are its orbital period (about 290 days) and its inclination (approximately 90\u00b0). Evidence suggests that the planet has a moderate surface temperature, assuming that the surface is not subject to extreme greenhouse heating. In the absence of an atmosphere, its equilibrium temperature (assuming an Earth-like albedo) would be approximately 279 K (6 \u00b0C; 43 \u00b0F), slightly higher than that of Earth's 255 K (\u221218 \u00b0C; \u22121 \u00b0F).\nThe planet's first transit was observed on 12 May 2009. Confirmation of the existence of Kepler-22b was announced on December 5, 2011.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-186f (also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-571.05) is an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Kepler-186, the outermost of five such planets discovered around the star by NASA's Kepler space telescope. It is located about 580 light-years (180 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\nKepler-186f orbits its star at a distance of about 0.43 AU (64,000,000 km; 40,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 130 days, and a mass and radius around 1.44 and 1.17 times that of Earth, respectively. As one of the more promising candidates for habitability, it was the first planet with a radius similar to Earth's to be discovered in the habitable zone of another star. However, key components still need to be found to determine its habitability for life, including an atmosphere and its composition and if liquid water can exist on its surface.\nAnalysis of three years of data was required to find its signal. NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope detected it using the transit method (in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured), along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth).  The results were presented initially at a conference on 19 March 2014 and some details were reported in the media at the time. The planet was announced on 17 April 2014, simultaneously with publication of a scientific paper in Science.\n\n"

A planetary system of at least three exoplanets with sizes between Mars and Venus has been detected around this red dwarf on January 11, 2012, by the method of transits with the help of the space telescope Kepler.\nKepler-42 c is a planet with a radius 0.73 times that of Earth. It orbits its star in a little less than 11 hours at about 0.006 AU of its host star and has an average equilibrium temperature of about 445 \u00b0C (833 \u00b0F). Due to the temperature, it is not suitable for life.\nIt is tidally locked in a synchronous rotation. Thus, it makes one complete rotation each time it completes an orbit. As a result, there is an eternal day side and a permanent night side."

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets transiting their stars.\nThe star hosts three confirmed planets and a likely fourth, including the lowest-mass exoplanet with a measured mass and size discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars.  Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf, more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-1649c is an Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Kepler-1649, the outermost planet of the planetary system discovered by Kepler\u2019s space telescope. It is located about 301 light-years (92 pc) away from Earth, in the constellation of Cygnus. \nKepler-1649c orbits its star a\ndistance of 0.0649 AU (9.71 million km; 6.03 million mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 19.53 days, has a mass 1.2x times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.02 times that of Earth. Based on its mass and radius, it is likely a terrestrial planet, though its proximity to its star means it may likely be tidally locked. Kepler-1649c is estimated to receive about three-quarters of radiation from its host star as Earth does from the Sun.\nIn 2017, Jeff Coughlin, the director of SETI's K2 Science Office, described it as the most \"similar planet to Earth\" found so far by the Kepler Space Telescope. The planet was initially deemed a false positive by Kepler's  robovetter algorithm. The  Kepler False Positive Working Group published its recovery on April 15, 2020. Its first scientific description was published in The  Astrophysical Journal Letters, with first author Andrew Vanderburg, in April 2020.\n\n"

The mass of this planet is about one half that of Jupiter, but its radius is nearly 50% larger than Jupiter's, making the density of this planet only one quarter that of water; it is thought that some other form of heating must explain its extremely low density. WASP-15b's discovery was published on April 29, 2009."

It was announced on June 13, 2016, in San Diego at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. It was detected using the transit method, when it caused the dimming of the primary star, and then again of the secondary star blended with the primary star eclipse.\nThe first transit of the planet was identified in 2012, but at the time the single event was not enough to rule out contamination, or confirm it as a planet. It was discovered by the analysis of the Kepler light-curve, which showed the planet in transit."

The star is slightly cooler than the sun, with roughly half its metallicity. It is known to have five planets, including the first Earth-sized world discovered in the habitable zone: Kepler-186f.

        "description": "Kepler-452b (sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earth's Cousin based on its characteristics; also known by its Kepler object of interest designation KOI-7016.01) is a candidate super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the inner edge of the habitable zone of the sun-like star Kepler-452 and is the only planet in the system discovered by the Kepler space telescope. It is located about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.\nKepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 385 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.5 times that of Earth. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very Sun-like star. However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy from its star than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.\nThe Kepler space telescope identified the exoplanet, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015. The planet is about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New Horizons spacecraft, at about 59,000 km/h (16,000 m/s; 37,000 mph), it would take approximately 30 million years to get there.\n\n"

It has a mass of around 2.3 and has a radius of about 1.34 times that of Earth. It is one of the more promising candidates for potential habitability, as its parent star is at least 40% less massive than the Sun \u2013 thus, it can have a lifespan of about 30 billion years.\nThe planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft using the transit method, in which it measures the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star. NASA announced the confirmation of the exoplanet on 6 January 2015.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

Its discovery is attributed to the combined effort of amateur and professional astronomers working together on the XO Project using a telescope located on the Haleakala summit in Hawaii.\nDubbed an \"oddball\" planet, at the time of its discovery the planet was the most massive planet found in close proximity to a star, yet the orbit is significantly elliptical instead of circular, as would be expected. It is also considered a transiting planet, passing in front of its parent star during each orbit. It is the third such planet to be found by the XO Project which was specifically created to locate them."

The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The planet was previously proposed in 2012 when reports of its host star recorded drops in its luminosity varying from 0.2% to 1.3%, which indicated a possible planetary companion rapidly disintegrating. In 2015, the planetary nature of the cause of the dips was finally verified. It is expected to disintegrate in about 40\u2013400 million years."

As of its discovery KELT-2Ab is the fifth-brightest transiting Hot Jupiter known that has a well constrained mass. This makes the KELT-2A system a promising target for future space- and ground-based follow-up observations to learn about the planet's atmosphere.\nThe water vapour was detected in planetary atmosphere in 2018. \nThe star KELT-2A is a member of the common-proper-motion binary star system KELT-2 (HD 42176).

        "description": "WASP-18b is an exoplanet that is notable for having an orbital period of less than one day. It has a mass equal to 10 Jupiter masses, just below the boundary line between planets and brown dwarfs (about 13 Jupiter masses). Due to tidal deceleration, it is expected to spiral toward and eventually merge with its host star, WASP-18, in less than a million years. The planet is approximately 3.1 million km (1.9 million mi; 0.021 AU) from its star, which is about 400 light-years (120 parsecs) from Earth. A team led by Coel Hellier, a professor of astrophysics at Keele University in England, discovered the exoplanet in 2009.\nScientists at Keele and at the University of Maryland are working to understand whether the discovery of this planet so shortly before its expected demise (with less than 0.1% of its lifetime remaining) was fortuitous, or whether tidal dissipation by WASP-18 is actually much less efficient than astrophysicists typically assume. Observations made over the next decade should yield a measurement of the rate at which WASP-18b's orbit is decaying.\nThe closest example of a similar situation in the Solar System is Mars' moon Phobos. Phobos orbits Mars at a distance of only about 9,000 km (5,600 mi), 40 times closer than the Moon is to the Earth and is expected to be destroyed in about eleven million years.\nThe planet's dayside temperature, as measured in 2020, is 3,029 \u00b1 50 K (2,755.8 \u00b1 50.0 \u00b0C; 4,992.5 \u00b1 90.0 \u00b0F). A 2023 study found an average dayside temperature of 2,781+25\u221213 K (2,508 \u00b0C; 4,546 \u00b0F).\nA study in 2012, utilizing the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect, determined that the planetary orbit is well aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, with a misalignment equal to 13\u00b17\u00b0.\nA 2017 study detected carbon monoxide in the planet's atmosphere, without signs of water vapor. However, in 2023, the James Webb Space Telescope detected water vapor in the planet's atmosphere.\n\n"

HD 219134 b has a size of about 1.6 R\ud83d\udf28, and a density of 6.4 g/cm3 and orbits at 21.25 light-years away. The exoplanet was initially detected by the instrument HARPS-N of the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo via the radial velocity method and subsequently observed by the Spitzer telescope as transiting in front of its star. The exoplanet has a mass of about 4.5 times that of Earth and orbits its host star every three days. In 2017, it was found that the planet likely hosts an atmosphere.\n\n"

The star is similar to the Sun and forms a binary star with a red dwarf star (WASP-8B) of half the Sun's mass that orbits WASP-8A 4.5 arcseconds away. The system is 294 light-years (90 parsecs) away and is therefore located closer to Earth than many other star systems that are known to feature planets similar to WASP-8b. The planet and its parent star were discovered in the SuperWASP batch -6b to -15b. On 1 April 2008, Dr. Don Pollacco of Queen's University Belfast announced them at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting (NAM 2008).\n\n"

        "description": "XO-2Nb (or rarely XO-2Bb) is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star XO-2N, the fainter component of XO-2 wide binary star in the constellation Lynx. This planet was found by the transit method in 2007 by Burke et al. This was the second such planet found by the XO telescope.\n\nLike most planets found by the transit method, it is a roughly Jupiter sized planet that orbits very close to its host star; in this case, it has a surface temperature of about 1200 K, so it belongs to a group of exoplanets known as hot Jupiters. The planet takes 2.6 days to orbit the star at the average distance of 0.0369 AU. The planet has mass of 57% of Jupiter and radius of 97% of Jupiter. The radius is relatively large for its mass, probably due to its intense heating from its nearby star that bloats the planet's atmosphere. The large radius for its mass gives a low density of 820 kg/m3.\n\n"

The star system is much younger than the Sun at 300 million to 1.2 billion years age, and is heavily enriched in heavy elements, having nearly twice the concentration of iron compared to the Sun.\nThe primary, WASP-8A, is a magnitude 9.9 main-sequence yellow dwarf star. It is reported to be a G-type star with a temperature of 5600 K and has a mass 1.093\u00b10.024, a radius 0.976\u00b10.020 and a luminosity of 0.79 times that of the Sun. There is a companion star WASP-8B located 4.5 arcseconds away with the same proper motion, indicating a stellar binary system. The binarity was confirmed in 2020. The axis orientation of the primary star is uncertain, but it is close to pointing one of the poles to the Earth."

        "description": "WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b or WASP-11Ab/HAT-P-10Ab is an extrasolar planet discovered in 2008. The discovery was announced (under the designation WASP-11b) by press release by the SuperWASP project in April 2008 along with planets WASP-6b through to WASP-15b, however at this stage more data was needed to confirm the parameters of the planets and the coordinates were not given. On 26 September 2008, the HATNet Project's paper describing the planet which they designated HAT-P-10b appeared on the arXiv preprint server. The SuperWASP team's paper appeared as a preprint on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia on the same day, confirming that the two objects (WASP-11b and HAT-P-10b) were in fact the same, and the teams agreed to use the combined designation.\nThe planet had the third lowest insolation of the known transiting planets at the time of the discovery (prior to this, Gliese 436 b and HD 17156 b were known to have lower insolation). The temperature implies it falls into the pL class of hot Jupiters: planets which lack significant quantities of titanium(II) oxide and vanadium(II) oxide in their atmospheres and do not have temperature inversions. An alternative classification system for hot Jupiters is based on the equilibrium temperature and the planet's Safronov number. In this scheme, for a given temperature, class I planets have high Safronov numbers and tend to be in orbit around cooler host stars, while class II planets have lower Safronov numbers. In the case of WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b, the equilibrium temperature is 1030 K and the Safronov number is 0.047\u00b10.003, which means it is located close to the dividing line between the class I and class II planets.\nThe planet is in a binary star system, the second star is WASP-11 B, with a mass 0.34 \u00b1 0.05 of the Sun and a temperature of 3483 \u00b1 43 K.\n\n"

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

The planet was detected using the transit method, where a planet dims the host star's light as it passes in front of it. It was first announced on May 2, 2016, and later studies were able to refine its physical parameters.\nThe planet is about 37% more massive than Earth and about 39% larger in volume; thus its density is very similar. It is the innermost of seven planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1, all of which are terrestrial, but is too close to its star to be in the habitable zone. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope announced in 2023 suggest that it does not have any significant atmosphere. Its albedo is very low, making it dark in color.\n\n"

Since it orbits its star very closely, the planet is a strongly irradiated hot Jupiter. As seen from the Earth, WASP-28b transits its host star every 3.41 days taking about 3 hours to do so.\nThe planet was observed by the Kepler space telescope during the K2 mission engineering campaign in February 2014 as part of an early science demonstration. It was also observed from December 2016 to March 2017 during K2's campaign 12 which allowed a refinement of the system parameters."

Astronomers used the transit method to find the exoplanet, a method that measures the dimming of a star when a planet crosses in front of it.\nThe exoplanet was one of seven discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Three of the seven (e, f, and g) are in the habitable zone/\"goldilocks\" zone. TRAPPIST-1e is similar to Earth's mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux. It is also confirmed that TRAPPIST-1e lacks a cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, meaning it is more likely to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. \nIn November 2018, researchers determined that of the seven exoplanets in the multi-planetary system, TRAPPIST-1e has the best chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet, and the one most worthy of further study regarding habitability. According to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, TRAPPIST-1e is among the best potentially habitable exoplanets discovered.\n\n"

        "description": "GJ 1214 b (sometimes Gliese 1214 b, also named Enaiposha since 2023) is an exoplanet that orbits the star GJ 1214, and was discovered in December 2009. Its parent star is 48 light-years from the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. As of 2017, GJ 1214 b is the most likely known candidate for being an ocean planet. For that reason, scientists often call the planet a \"waterworld\". However, a recent study of the planet's internal structure informed by observations taken with the James Webb Space Telescope suggests that a \"waterworld\" composition is implausible, with the planet being more likely to host a thick gaseous envelope consisting of hydrogen, helium, water and other volatile species such as methane or carbon dioxide.\nIt is a super-Earth, meaning it is larger than Earth but is significantly smaller (in mass and radius) than the gas giants of the Solar System. After CoRoT-7b, it was the second super-Earth to have both its mass and radius measured and is the first of a new class of planets with small size and relatively low density. GJ 1214 b is also significant because its parent star is relatively near the Sun and because it transits that parent star, which allows the planet's atmosphere to be studied using spectroscopic methods.\nIn December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214 b.\n\n"

The exoplanet was found by using the transit method. The first signs of the planet were announced in 2016, but it was not until the following years that more information concerning the probable nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the second-least massive planet of the system and is likely to have a compact hydrogen-poor atmosphere similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars. It receives just 4.3% more sunlight than Earth, placing it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about <5% of its mass as a volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers. A 2018 study by the University of Washington concluded that TRAPPIST-1d might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The planet is an eyeball planet candidate.\n\n"

It is the innermost of three Super-Earths around the star K2-148, which is in a wide binary pair with the M0.5V red dwarf EPIC 220194953. K2-148b is the smallest planet of the system, at about a third larger than Earth, and could be terrestrial in nature. However, the three planets do not exhibit significant transit timing variations, implying that they could have relatively low masses. The planet was validated in early 2018 by Hirano et al. and is too hot for known life.\n\n"

Thus, it orbits very rapidly, with one year lasting just 2.64 days (63 hours), and is far too hot to be habitable, with an equilibrium temperature of 534 K (261 \u00b0C; 502 \u00b0F)."

It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting the star in 2017 using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The exoplanet is within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.\nThe second most distant known planet in its system, TRAPPIST-1g is a planet somewhat larger than Earth and with a similar density, meaning it is likely a rocky planet.\n\n"

It was discovered by citizen scientists while analysing data from the Kepler space telescope's K2 mission, and was announced on 7 January 2019. K2-288 is the third transiting planet system identified by the Exoplanet Explorers program, after the six planets of K2-138 and the three planets of K2-233.\nK2-288Bb is likely to be in the habitable zone of its host star, and thus may be capable of supporting life, though the planet's composition is unknown.\n\n"

It orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone of a red dwarf, Kepler-438, about 460.2 light-years  from Earth in the constellation Lyra. It receives 1.4 times our solar flux. The planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. NASA announced the confirmation of the exoplanet on 6 January 2015."

        "description": "HAT-P-12b, formally named Puli, is an extrasolar planet approximately 468 light years away from Earth, orbiting the 13th magnitude K-type star HAT-P-12, which is located in Canes Venatici constellation. It is a transiting hot Jupiter that was discovered by the HATNet Project on April 29, 2009.\nHAT-P-12b is a H/He-dominated gas giant planet with a core mass of 11.3+2.6\u22122.1 M\ud83d\udf28 and is moderately irradiated by its low-metallicity host star. Therefore, HAT-P-12b is most likely an H/He-dominated planet with a core of perhaps ~10 M\ud83d\udf28, and a total metal fraction of ~15%. This makes HAT-P-12b the least massive H/He-dominated gas giant planet found to date; the previous record holder was Saturn.\nIn 2020, the obtained transmission spectra have revealed that the atmosphere of HAT-P-12b is cloudy, with haze above cloud tops. Water was detected. The prevalence of clouds and hazes in planetary atmosphere was disputed in 2021 though.\nIn August 2022, this planet and its host star were included among 20 systems to be named by the third NameExoWorlds project. The approved names, proposed by a team from Hungary, were announced in June 2023. HAT-P-12b is named Puli and its host star is named Komondor, after the Hungarian Puli and Komondor dog breeds."

        "description": "OGLE-TR-113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-113.\nIn 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) detected periodic dimming in the star's light curve indicating a transiting, planetary-sized object. Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet, radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004, the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet.\nThe planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, the value is exact. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-113) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days. The radius of the planet is only 9% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \"super-hot Jupiters\"."

        "description": "CoRoT-9b is an exoplanet orbiting the star CoRoT-9, approximately 1500 light years away in the constellation Serpens. CoRoT-9b's distance of nearest approach to its parent star of approximately 0.36 AU was the largest of all known transiting planets at the time of its discovery, with an orbital period of 95 days. The transit of this planet lasts 8 hours. The planet is at a distance from its star where there is a strong increase in albedo as the temperature decreases, because of the condensation of reflective water clouds in the atmosphere. This suggests its atmosphere may be locked into one of two states: a cloudless state with temperatures between 380 K (107 \u00b0C; 224 \u00b0F) and 430 K (157 \u00b0C; 314 \u00b0F), or covered in water clouds with a temperature in the range 250 K (\u221223 \u00b0C; \u221210 \u00b0F) to 290 K (17 \u00b0C; 62 \u00b0F).\n\n"

This planet was the first known exoplanet to be discovered with the transit method. The object was discovered by the OGLE project, announced on July 5, 2002 and confirmed on January 4, 2003 by the Doppler technique.\nThe period of this confirmed planet was the shortest until the confirmed discovery of WASP-12b on April 1, 2008. \nThe short period and proximity of the OGLE-TR-56 b to its host mean it belongs to a class of objects known as hot Jupiters.\n\nThe planet is thought to be only 4 stellar radii from its star, and hot enough to have iron rain."

        "description": "HD 179949 b, formally named Mastika, is an extrasolar planet discovered by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search at the Anglo-Australian Observatory, which orbits the star HD 179949. The planet is a so-called \"hot Jupiter\", a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting very close to its parent star. In this case, orbital distance is almost one-tenth that of Mercury from the Sun. One orbital revolution lasts only about 3 days.\nIts magnetic field induces a bright spot on its star at 30 degrees latitude, which rotates at 87 degrees inclination. If the planet orbited at 83-97 degrees, then its transit would be visible from Earth. The angle of inclination is therefore 83 degrees or less, but not much less; and its mass is about 0.92 Jupiter masses MJ. The star is not tidally locked to the planet.\nAssuming the planet is perfectly grey with no greenhouse or tidal effects, and a Bond albedo of 0.1, the temperature would be 1533 K.  This is, like Tau Bo\u00f6tis b, hotter than the predicted temperature of HD 209458 b (1392K), and close to that of HD 149026 b, before they were measured.\nSearches for water in the planet's atmosphere have been inconclusive at first, as have attempts to determine whether titanium and vanadium oxides are present. In the meantime, both carbon monoxide and water have been found in the dayside emission of HD 179949b.\nHD 179949 b is a candidate for \"near-infrared characterisation.... with the VLTI Spectro-Imager\".\nThe light reflected off planet could not be detected as in 2021, implying HD 179949 b has a low albedo.\nThe planet HD 179949 b is named Mastika. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Brunei, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Mastika is a Malay word, which means a gem, precious stone, jewel or the prettiest, the most beautiful."

        "description": "CoRoT-7b (previously named CoRoT-Exo-7b) is an exoplanet orbiting the star CoRoT-7 in the constellation of Monoceros, 489 light-years (150 parsecs) from Earth. It was first detected photometrically by the French-led CoRoT mission and reported in February 2009. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, it was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's) and the first potential extrasolar terrestrial planet to be found. The exoplanet has a very short orbital period, revolving around its host star in about 20 hours.\nCombination of the planet's diameter derived from transit data with the planet's mass derived from radial velocity measurements means that the density of CoRoT-7b is about the same as that of Earth; therefore, CoRoT-7b is a terrestrial planet like Earth and not a gas giant like Jupiter. The radial velocity observations of CoRoT-7 also detected a second super-Earth, CoRoT-7c, which has a mass 8.4 times that of Earth and orbits every 3.7 days at a distance of 6.9 million km (0.046 AU; 4.3 million mi).\n\n"

        "description": "HD 80606 b (also Struve 1341 Bb or HIP 45982 b) is an eccentric hot Jupiter 217 light-years from the Sun in the constellation of Ursa Major. HD 80606 b was discovered orbiting the star HD 80606 in April 2001 by a team led by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. With a mass 4 times that of Jupiter, it is a gas giant. Because the planet transits the host star its radius can be determined using the transit method, and was found to be about the same as Jupiter's. Its density is slightly less than Earth's. It has an extremely eccentric orbit like a comet, with its orbit taking it very close to its star and then back out very far away from it every 111 days.\n\n"

Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004 the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet.\nThe planet has a mass 1.14 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, this represents the best measured true mass of the planet, rather than simply the minimum mass as is the case when the inclination is unknown. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-132) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1 day 16.6 hours. The radius of the planet is only 18% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \"super-hot Jupiters\"."

        "description": "OGLE-TR-111b is an extrasolar planet approximately 5,000 light-years away in the constellation of Carina (the Keel).  The planet is currently the only confirmed planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-111 (though a possible second planet is plausible).\nIn 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey detected that the light from the star periodically dimmed very slightly every 4 days, indicating a planet-sized body transiting the star. But since the mass of the object had not been measured, it was not clear that it was a true planet, low-mass red dwarf or something else.\nIn 2004 radial velocity measurements showed unambiguously that the transiting body is indeed a planet.\nThe planet is probably very similar to the other hot Jupiters orbiting nearby stars. Its mass is about half that of Jupiter and it orbits the star at a distance less than 1/20th that of Earth from the Sun.\nOGLE-TR-111b has similar mass and orbital distance as the first transiting planet, HD 209458 b (Osiris).  But unlike it, the planet has a radius comparable to Jupiter which is typical to other transiting planets detected by OGLE. However, those other planets tend to be more massive and orbit even closer than typical hot Jupiters.  Therefore, this planet is an important \"missing link\" between the different types of transiting planets.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-10, formerly known as KOI-72, is a Sun-like star in the constellation of Draco that lies 607 light-years (186 parsecs) from Earth. Kepler-10 was targeted by NASA's Kepler space telescope, as it was seen as the first star identified by the Kepler mission that could be a possible host to a small, transiting exoplanet. The star is slightly less massive, slightly larger, and slightly cooler than the Sun; at an estimated 11.9 billion years in age, Kepler-10 is 2.3 times the age of the Sun. \nKepler-10 is host to a planetary system made up of at least three planets. Kepler-10b, the first undeniably rocky planet, was discovered in its orbit after eight months of observation and announced on January 10, 2011. The planet orbits its star closely, completing an orbit every 0.8 days, and has a density similar to that of iron. The second planet, Kepler-10c, was confirmed on May 23, 2011, based on follow-up observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The data shows it has an orbital period of 42.3 days and has a radius more than double that of Earth, but it was initially thought to have a higher density, making it the largest and most massive rocky planet discovered as of June 2014. However, refined mass measurements have shown it to be a more typical volatile-rich planet. A third planet, Kepler-10d, was discovered in 2023 by radial velocity observations.\n\n"

The planet was detected using gravitational microlensing techniques managed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and the Spitzer Space Telescope. \nInitially, it was believed the planet has a mass similar to Earth and is located about the same distance from its host star as the Earth is from the Sun, although it was expected to be much colder.\nIn 2023, the planetary mass estimate was significantly increased to 9.91\u00b11.61 ME, resulting in it likely being a Neptune-like ice giant planet."

        "description": "SWEEPS-11 is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star SWEEPS J175902.67\u2212291153.5 in the constellation Sagittarius, approximately 27,710 light years away from the Solar System (based on a distance modulus of 14.1), making it (along with SWEEPS-04) the most distant exoplanet(s) known. This planet was found in 2006 by the Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search (SWEEPS) program that uses the transit method.\nThis hot Jupiter has a mass 9.7 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.13 times that of Jupiter, but the uncertainty in this value is large, around 21%. The planet orbits at about 1.75 times closer to the star than 51 Pegasi b is to 51 Pegasi, taking only 1.8 days or 43 hours to orbit the star. It is also the most distant planet yet discovered.\n\n"

        "description": "MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, occasionally shortened to MOA-192 b, is an extrasolar planet approximately 7,000 light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius. The planet was discovered orbiting the low-mass star MOA-2007-BLG-192L. It was found when it caused a gravitational microlensing event on May 24, 2007, which was detected as part of the MOA-II microlensing survey at the Mount John University Observatory in New Zealand.\nThe mass of the planet is not well-known. It is anything between 2.75 and 105 Earth masses (ME), although it is more likely to be between 3 and 12 ME. The mass range also means that the planet's classification varies, from a Super-Earth to a Sub-Saturn. It is located at 2.02 astronomical units from its host star.\n\n"

The planet was discovered in June 2011 by the French-led CoRoT mission. CoRoT-16b was detected using the transit method, which measures the brightness changes during an eclipse. However, this planet has an eccentric orbit, which is unusual due to CoRoT-16b's proximity to its parent star and the age.\nDue to its orbit, CoRoT-16b is classified as a \"hot Jupiter\". It only takes about 5 days to orbit CoRoT-16, but has an unusually eccentric orbit. CoRoT-16b has 52.9% the mass of Jupiter, but is 17% larger than the latter. Due to the low mass and high radius, CoRoT-16b has 41% the density of water; the orbit gives it an equilibrium temperature of 1,086 K. However, this is only an estimate due to the eccentricity of CoRoT-16b."

        "description": "The list of exoplanets detected by the Kepler space telescope contains bodies with a wide variety of properties, with significant ranges in orbital distances, masses, radii, composition, habitability, and host star type. As of June 16 2023, the Kepler space telescope and its follow-up observations have detected 2,778 planets, including hot Jupiters, super-Earths, circumbinary planets, and planets located in the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars. Kepler has detected over 3,601 unconfirmed planet candidates and 2,165 eclipsing binary stars.\nIn addition to detecting planets itself, Kepler has also uncovered the properties of three previously known extrasolar planets. Public Kepler data has also been used by groups independent of NASA, such as the Planet Hunters citizen-science project, to detect several planets orbiting stars collectively known as Kepler Objects of Interest.\nKepler, launched on March 7, 2009, was designed to observe a fixed portion of the sky in visible light and measure the light curves of the various stars in its field of view, looking for planets crossing in front of their host stars via the transit method. Since the launch of the spacecraft, though, both the Kepler team at NASA and independent researchers have found new ways of detecting planets, including the use of the transit timing variation method and relativistic beaming. In addition, gravitational microlensing has been proposed as a method of using Kepler to detect compact objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Kepler has also measured the reflected light from some planets already known, discovering planets undetectable with the transit method as well as improving knowledge of the characteristics of planets already discovered.\nOn February 26, 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the Kepler Space Telescope. The exoplanets were found using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nOn May 10, 2016, NASA announced that the Kepler mission has verified 1,284 new planets. Based on some of the planet's sizes, about 550 could potentially be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars' habitable zone.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-138, also known as KOI-314, is a red dwarf located in the constellation Lyra, 219 light years from Earth. It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets transiting their stars.\nThe star hosts three confirmed planets and a likely fourth, including the lowest-mass exoplanet with a measured mass and size discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars.  Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf, more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.\n\n"

        "description": "Kepler-16b (formally Kepler-16 (AB)-b) is a Saturn-mass exoplanet consisting of half gas and half rock and ice. It orbits a binary star, Kepler-16, with a period of 229 days. \"[It] is the first confirmed, unambiguous example of a circumbinary planet \u2013 a planet orbiting not one, but two stars,\" said Josh Carter of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, one of the discovery team.\nKepler-16b is also unusual in that it falls inside the radius that was thought to be the inner limit for planet formation in a binary star system. According to Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it was thought that for a planet to have a stable orbit around such a system, it would need to be at least seven times as far from the stars as the stars are from each other. Kepler-16b's orbit is only about half that distance.\nKepler-16b orbits near the outer edge of the habitable zone, but it is a gas giant with surface temperatures around \u2212100 to \u221270 \u00b0C (\u2212150 to \u221294 \u00b0F).\n\n"
